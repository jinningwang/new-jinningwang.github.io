In the realms of art and science, the relationship between expression and core content shows significant differences.
This perspective came to me during an English course, and recently, after a peculiar dream, I thought of an argument supporting this viewpoint.

For art, even if the core idea remains the same, using different forms of expression can be considered innovative.
Art carries human subjective emotions, and different forms of expression can trigger different emotional experiences.

For example:
Painting: The same theme can be expressed through oil painting, watercolor, sketching, etc., each bringing different visual effects and emotional resonance.
Music: A pop songâ€™s studio version, live concert version, and versions remade with different instrumental effects all provide different auditory experiences and emotional reactions.
This diversity and innovation allow art to continually bring new feelings and inspirations to people.

In contrast, science explores objective laws, and as long as the core idea is the same, it does not bring new knowledge.
Scientific discoveries emphasize substance rather than form of expression.
Here are some reasons:

- Objectivity of Science: Scientific discoveries need to convey information accurately, avoiding misunderstandings or ambiguities. Different forms of expression might lead to distortion or misunderstanding of information.
- Verification and Reproducibility: Scientific discoveries need to be verified and replicated to confirm their reliability. Different forms of expression might affect the reproducibility and verification process.
- Professional Audience: The audience for scientific discoveries is usually professionals who focus more on the substantive content and data rather than the form of expression.

In summary, art and science show significant differences in the relationship between expression and core content.
The diversity and innovation in art lie in its changing forms of expression, while the rigor and objectivity in science lie in its stable core content.
Understanding this helps us better appreciate the unique charm of both art and scientific discoveries.
