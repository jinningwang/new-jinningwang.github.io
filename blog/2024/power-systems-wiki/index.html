Inspired by a talk titled “Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago – What Has Changed?” that began on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to excerpt terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and other traceable sources to build a wiki for my own reference. For any suggestions or corrections, please email me at <a href="mailto:jinninggm@gmail.com">jinninggm@gmail.com</a> with the subject line <strong>Suggestion on Power Systems Wiki</strong>.

Frequency Response occurs within the first few seconds following a change in system frequency (disturbance) to stabilize the Interconnection.</p> <p><strong><em>Secondary Control</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2021balancing"></d-cite> typically includes the balancing services deployed in the “minutes” time frame. Some resources however, such as hydroelectric generation, can respond faster in many cases. This control is accomplished using the Balancing Authority’s control computer (terms most often associated with this are <strong>“Load-Frequency Control”</strong> or <strong>“Automatic Generation Control”</strong>) and the manual actions taken by the dispatcher to provide additional adjustments. Secondary Control also includes initial reserve deployment for disturbances.</p> <p>In short, Secondary Control maintains the minute-to-minute balance throughout the day and is used to restore frequency to its scheduled value, usually 60 Hz, following a disturbance. Secondary Control is provided by both <strong>Spinning</strong> and <strong>Non-Spinning Reserves</strong>.</p> <div style="text-align: ;left;"> <img src="/assets/img/pswiki/frequency_trend.png" alt="Typical Frequency Trend for the Loss of a Generating Resource" style="width: 700px; height: auto;"> <p><em> Typical Frequency Trend for the Loss of a Generating Resource (from <d-cite key="nerc2021balancing"></d-cite>).

The model resides and is maintained by the PJM staff on the PJM Energy Management System (EMS). The PJM EMS Network Application programs utilize the model to continuously calculate the <strong>real-time state</strong> and determine the <strong>security</strong> of the PJM system. The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) dispatches every generator in the model. The model is also used to calculate real-time Locational Marginal Prices. The model is created and maintained from input data received by PJM from various sources including Transmission Owners, Generation Owners, Load Serving Entities, and other Balancing Authorities. The model is only as accurate as the input data used to derive it; therefore, timely and accurate data updates are critical.</p> <p><strong><em>Thermal Limit Operation Criteria</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p29, Revision 67) PJM uses the following techniques to control contingency or system violations:</p> <ul> <li>Adjusting PARs.</li> <li>Switching reactive devices in/out of service or adjusting generator MVAR output.</li> <li>Switching transmission facilities in/out of service.</li> <li>Adjusting generation MW output via redispatch.</li> <li>Adjusting imports/exports.</li> <li>Issuing a TLR (Transmission Loading Relief).</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Voltage Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p40, Revision 67) High, Low, and Load Dump actual voltage limits, High and Low emergency voltage limits for contingency simulation, and voltage drop limits for wide area transfer simulations to protect against wide area voltage collapse.</p> <p><strong><em>Transfer Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p40, Revision 67) The MW flow limitation across an interface to protect the system from large voltage drops or collapse caused by any viable contingency.</p> <p><strong><em>Stability Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p40, Revision 67) is limit based on <strong>voltage phase angle difference</strong> to protect portions of the PJM RTO from separation or unstable operation.</p> <p><strong><em>Stability Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m11"></d-cite> (p82, Revision 133) The ability of a generating unit or a group of generating units to maintain synchronism following a system disturbance can be identified using real time and study applications such as the PJM Transient Stability Analysis (TSA) tool.

EUE is energy-centric and analyzes all hours of a particular year. Results are calculated in <strong>megawatthours (MWh)</strong>. EUE is the summation of the expected number of megawatthours of load that will not be served in a given year as a result of demand exceeding the available capacity across all hours. Additionally, this measure can be normalized based on the assessment area’s total Net Energy for Load. Normalizing the EUE provides a measure relative to the size of a given assessment area.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-Load Hour (LOLH)</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite> is generally defined as the number of hours per year where system demand will exceed the generating capacity. LOLH is usually expressed in <strong>hours per year</strong>. Any outage caused by inadequate resources regardless of geographic extent or load interrupted (it could be 1 MW for a single customer or the loss of the whole area load) counts as a LOLH. An LOLH of 0.1 means that an hour of loss of load is expected for every 10 years. For a particular year (e.g. 2014), the resources available and load shapes for that year are used to calculate the metrics for that year.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-load expectation (LOLE)</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite> is generally defined as number of days per year for which the available generation capacity is insufficient to serve the demand at least once during that day. This metric is not being reported as part of this assessment. A criterion of one day in 10 years is an often used standard for LOLE.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-load probability (LOLP)</em></strong> is the probability of system demand exceeding the generating capacity during a given period. If LOLP is the number of days on which there is expected to be a shortfall per year, it is the same as LOLE. However, other definitions of LOLP are also used.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-load events (LOLEV)</em></strong> is the number of events in which some system load is not served in a given year. A LOLEV can last for one hour or for several contiguous hours and can involve the loss of one or several hundred megawatts of load. TRE-ERCOT is the only Assessment Area to provide this metric in its regional assessment.</p> <h2 id="operating-reliability">Operating Reliability</h2> <p><strong><em>Severity Risk Index (SRI)</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2020sri"></d-cite> (p5) is a <strong>daily metric</strong> where transmission loss, generation loss, and load loss events aggregate into a single value that indicates performance of the BES. The SRI values range from zero to 1000. Zero is a theoretical condition where no transmission, generation or load loss occurred during the entire day. To the corollary, a value of 1000 would represent a situation where every transmission, generation and load5 was lost during the entire day. The SRI was designed to be usable for the entirety of NERC as well as applied more granularly, such as at an interconnection level.</p> <p><strong><em>SRI</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2024sor"></d-cite> (p12) The SRI provides a quantitative measure that assesses the relative severity of the combined impact of load, generation, and transmission loss on the BPS daily and offers a comprehensive picture of the performance of the BPS, allowing NERC to assess year-on-year reliability trends.</p> <h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2> <p><strong><em>System flexibility</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2010flexible"></d-cite> (in Executive Summary on page I) is defined as the ability of supply-side and demand-side resources to respond to system changes and uncertainties.

The metric will consider the instances of customer service interruptions that have been restored automatically without requiring human intervention to capture the value of technology solutions such as distribution automation, advanced distribution management system (ADMS), or microgrids, that minimize customer impacts. It will measure the number of reportable storms where recovery is favorable to threshold values divided by the total number of reportable storms.</p> <p><strong><em>Non-Storm Resilience Metric</em></strong> by IEEE <d-cite key="chiu2020resilience"></d-cite> (p13) This metric focuses on robustness and the ability to withstand events. It is designed to capture the total number of gray sky days (GSD) in a calendar year with no more than the threshold value of customer interruptions. The metric is measured in a percentage of GSDs that does not exceed the threshold value. The threshold value varies by utility size and is defined as the percentage of customer interruptions over the total customer base (e.g.,0.375% of the total number of customers). GSD excludes any calendar day with at least one reportable storm-related outage.</p> <p><strong><em>Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)-based metrics</em></strong> by DOE GMLC <d-cite key="chiu2020resilience"></d-cite> (p13): MCDA metrics generally try to answer the question, “what is the current state of the electric system’s resilience, and what enhances its resilience over time?” These metrics can be used to assess the system’s baseline resilience relative to other systems. They typically include categories of system properties beneficial to resilience, such as robustness, resourcefulness, adaptivity, and recoverability. The application of these metrics requires following a process to review to what degree these properties are present within the system under analysis. This usually involves collecting data through surveys, developing weighting factors, and performing calculations to obtain numerical scores. MCDA metrics are used to calculate a resilience index (RI) that accounts for about 1,200 attributes grouped in 350 categories to characterize system resilience.</p> <p><strong><em>Performance-based metrics</em></strong> by DOE GMLC <d-cite key="chiu2020resilience"></d-cite> (p13): performance-based metrics (also known as <strong><em>consequence-based metrics</em></strong>) are generally quantitative approaches for answering the question, “How resilient is my system?” These metrics interpret quantitative data that describe infrastructure performance during disruptive events. The required data can be collected from historical events, subject matter estimates, and computational infrastructure models. These metrics are suitable for benefit-cost and planning analyses because they measure the potential benefits and costs associated with proposed resilience improvements and investments. Resilience metrics need to include a measure of consequences and the relevant statistical probability from the probability distribution of those consequences.</p> <h2 id="transmission-expansion-and-interconnection">Transmission Expansion and Interconnection</h2> <p><strong><em>Transmission Expansion</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p4, Version 4.2): A transmission expansion is the <strong>addition or modification</strong> of facilities of the NYS Transmission System that may be proposed or initiated by an Eligible Customer, including a TO, under Section 3.7 of or Attachment P to the NYISO OATT.</p> <p><strong><em>Interconnection</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p28, Version 4.2): In the context of this manual, an interconnection refers to the connection of a new <strong>Generating Facility</strong>, Class Year Transmission Project, or <strong>Load</strong> to the NYS Transmission System; or to materially increase the capacity of, or make a material modification to the operating characteristics of, an existing Generating Facility (including a BTM:NG Resource) or Class Year Transmission Project that is interconnected to the NYS Transmission System or Distribution System (see definition of “Interconnection Request” and related capitalized terms in Attachment X and Attachment Z to the NYISO OATT).</p> <p><strong><em>System Impact Study (SIS)</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p16, Version 4.2), The purpose of the SIS is to evaluate the impact of the proposed transmission project on the reliability of the NYS Transmission System and if study results indicate that the project, as proposed, would result in any adverse impact on reliability or violations of reliability standards and identify any Network Upgrades that would be required to mitigate any such adverse impact(s) or violation(s).</p> <p><strong><em>Facilities Study</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p21, Version 4.2), The main purpose and objective of the Facilities Study is to provide to the Customer good faith estimates of the cost and time to construct the new facilities identified in the SIS.</p> <h2 id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h2> <p><strong><em>Aleatoric (aka statistical) uncertainty</em></strong> <d-cite key="hullermeier2021aleatoric"></d-cite> refers to the notion of randomness, that is, the variability in the outcome of an experiment which is due to <strong>inherently random effects</strong>.</p> <p><strong><em>Epistemic (aka systematic) uncertainty</em></strong> <d-cite key="hullermeier2021aleatoric"></d-cite> refers to uncertainty caused by a <strong>lack of knowledge</strong> (about the best model).

It supports various applications, including energy management systems, SCADA, and planning and optimization1.</p> <p>The <strong>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</strong> is a <strong>standard model</strong> for data interchange on the web. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), RDF allows for the representation of information about resources in a graph form. RDF uses triples, which consist of a subject, predicate, and object, to make statements about resources. This model is highly flexible and can represent complex relationships between data. RDF is often used in conjunction with other web standards like SPARQL for querying RDF data, and it supports various serialization formats such as RDF/XML, Turtle, and JSON-LD23.</p> <p>The <strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</strong> is a standardized general-purpose <strong>modeling language</strong> in the field of software engineering. UML provides a set of graphical notation techniques to create visual models of software-intensive systems. It includes various types of diagrams, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams, to represent different aspects of a system. UML is widely used for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. It helps in understanding, designing, and managing complex software projects45.</p> <p>The <strong>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</strong> is a <strong>markup language</strong> designed to store and transport data. XML allows developers to define their own tags and structure data in a platform-independent way. It is widely used for data interchange between different systems and platforms. XML documents are made up of elements defined by starting and ending tags, and they can include attributes to provide additional information about the data. XML is used in various applications, including web services, configuration files, and data exchange formats67.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <ul> <li>CIM: Standard for modeling power system components and measurements, used for data exchange in the electric power industry.</li> <li>RDF: Framework for representing information about resources in a graph form, used for data interchange on the web.</li> <li>UML: General-purpose modeling language for visualizing and documenting software systems.</li> <li>XML: Markup language for storing and transporting data, allowing for custom tag definitions and platform-independent data exchange.</li> </ul> <p>Summary of what CIM is not:</p> <ul> <li>CIM is not a programming language: It is a standard for modeling power system components and measurements.</li> <li>CIM is not a software application: It provides a common data model for information exchange but is not an executable program.</li> <li>CIM is not a database: While it can be used to define data structures, it is not a database management system.</li> <li>CIM is not a communication protocol: It defines data models and schemas but does not specify how data is transmitted between systems.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Common Format for Event Data Exchange (COMFEDE) for Power Systems</em></strong> <d-cite key="ieee2010comfede"></d-cite> This standard defines a common format for the data files needed for the exchange of various types of power network events in order to facilitate event data integration and analysis from multiple data sources and from different vendor devices. The flexibility provided by digital devices in recording network fault event data in the electric utility industry has generated the need for a standard format for the exchange of data. These data are being used with various devices to enhance and automate the analysis, testing, evaluation, and simulation of power systems and related protection schemes during fault and disturbance conditions. Since each source of data may use a different proprietary format, a common data format is necessary to facilitate the exchange of such data between applications. This will facilitate the use of proprietary data in diverse applications and allow users of one proprietary system to use digital data from other systems. <strong>A sample file is given in the source file.</strong></p> <p>Versions: Inactive</p> <ul> <li>Draft: PC37.239/D04, Mar 2010 - Dec 31, 2010</li> <li>Reserved: C37.239-2010 - Nov 11, 2010</li> <li>Draft: C37.239 - Jan 01, 2010</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Common Format for Transient Data Exchange (COMTRADE) for Power Systems</em></strong> <d-cite key="ieee1999comtrade"></d-cite> A common format for data files and exchange medium used for the interchange of various types of fault, test, or simulation data for electrical power systems is defined. Sources of transient data are described, and the case of disketts as an exchange medium is recommended. issues of sampling rates, filters, and sample rate conversions for transient data being exchanged are discussed. Files for data exchange are specified, as is the organization of the data. <strong>A sample file is given in the source file.</strong></p> <p>Versions: Superseded</p> <ul> <li>C37.111-1999 - Oct 15, 1999</li> <li>C37.111-1991 - Oct 21, 1991</li> </ul> <p>Inactive</p> <ul> <li>Reserved: C37.111-2013 - Apr 30, 2013</li> <li>Redline: C37.111-2013 - Apr 30, 2013</li> <li>Draft: PC37.111/D4, Jan 2012 - Jul 24, 2012</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Common Format for Exchange of Solved Load Flow Data</em></strong> <d-cite key="ieee1973loadflow"></d-cite>, also referred as common data format (CDF).
