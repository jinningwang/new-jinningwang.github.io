In disgust, for example, you see a raised upper lip, a wrinkled nose bridge, and raised cheeks.</p> <p>Although basic emotions are sometimes accompanied by unique facial expressions and behavioral responses, there is no one-one correspondence between emotions and how they appear. Take the universally recognizable facial expressions. Very talented actors can mimic these facial expressions without having the associated emotion. Conversely, most of us are masters in suppressing facial expressions accompanying emotions. You might feel genuinely sad, yet put on a big smile before entering your workplace, thereby deceiving your colleagues into thinking that you are cheerful.</p> <p>Even when our emotional expressions reflect our inner mental life, they need not be universally recognizable. This is because the basic emotions can trigger many other expressions besides the unique facial expressions, physiological responses, and tendencies to act. Examples:</p> <ol> <li>Intense sadness might give rise to a facial expression nearly indistinguishable from anger or rage.</li> <li>Mild sadness may not look like anything at all.</li> <li>When several emotions are simultaneously present, one of the emotions may dominate and show up on your face.</li> <li>When emotions last for a long time, they pop in and out of your conscious awareness. When you are not aware of them, It is much harder to detect them.</li> </ol> <p>Basic emotions likely have made significant contributions to our survival since the beginning of human history. When understood in this sense, “basic”—as it occurs in “basic emotion”—just means primordial (evolutionarily basic).</p> <p>But if an emotion is truly basic, how could it have more basic components? Take surprise. We can split surprise into two responses: one is a positive sense of interest and wonder, and the other is a negative feeling of panic. Why call surprise “basic” when it’s composed of other emotions?</p> <p>The reason for this is that “basic” does not mean “lacks components.”</p> <p>In fact, complex emotions vary a lot in what they are like in different people, situations, and cultures. Although grief is often taken to be a blend of surprise, denial, sadness and anger, grief can be entirely different in some people or cultures. For example, some people grieve a loss without ever showing anger. Others grieve by being absolutely furious.</p> <p>Grief is often said to be composed of surprise, denial, bargaining, fear, anger, sadness, and acceptance. These components are not usually present all at the same time during a grieving episode but tend to occur sequentially and not necessarily in the order I just listed them in. Although grief can involve these building blocks, it can be manifested in numerous other ways. If the loss was expected, surprise may not be a component. If you are grieving the death of a loved one, the grief may not involve denial or bargaining. If, by contrast, you are grieving a breakup, you may go through long periods of denying that the breakup really is a breakup and ferociously negotiate and bargain with your ex. Grief can also involve alterations in mood, including feelings of depression, despair, melancholy, irritability or anxiety as well as temporary changes in the manifest features of personality, for instance, shifting toward isolation, insecurity, emotionality, and vigilance.</p> <p>It’s likely because complex emotions can be a blend of different mental states in different people, situations and cultures that they do not give rise to a facial expression that is universally recognized.</p> <hr/> <h1 id="基本情绪和复杂情绪">基本情绪和复杂情绪</h1> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Berit Brogaard D.M.Sci., Ph.D | 2018年6月30日</td> <td>审阅：Jessica Schrader</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>文化差异与进化优势</p> <p>在哲学和心理学中，情绪通常被分为两类：基本情绪和复杂情绪。</p> <p>复杂情绪，如悲伤、后悔和嫉妒，具有高度可变的表现形式和组成部分。</p> <p>基本情绪包括悲伤、愤怒、恐惧、厌恶、蔑视、快乐和惊讶，它们之所以被称为“基本”，是因为它们与普遍可识别的面部表情相关联。 例如，在厌恶的情绪中，你会看到上唇抬起、鼻梁皱起、面颊上扬。</p> <p>虽然基本情绪有时伴随着独特的面部表情和行为反应，但情绪和它们的表现之间并不存在一一对应关系。 以那些普遍可识别的面部表情为例。 非常有才华的演员可以模仿这些面部表情，而不产生相应的情绪。 相反，我们大多数人都擅长抑制伴随情绪的面部表情。 你可能真的感到悲伤，但在进入工作场所前露出大大的笑容，从而让同事误以为你很开心。</p> <p>即使我们的情绪表达反映了内心的精神生活，它们也未必是普遍可识别的。 这是因为基本情绪除了独特的面部表情、生理反应和行为倾向之外，还会引发许多其他的表现。 例子如下：</p> <ol> <li>强烈的悲伤可能导致的面部表情几乎无法与愤怒或暴怒区分开来。</li> <li>轻微的悲伤可能根本没有任何外在表现。</li> <li>当几种情绪同时存在时，其中一种情绪可能会占据主导地位，并在你的脸上表现出来。</li> <li>当情绪持续较长时间时，它们会在你的意识中进进出出。当你没有意识到它们时，情绪变得更难被察觉。</li> </ol> <p>基本情绪很可能自人类历史开端以来对我们的生存做出了重要贡献。 在这个意义上，“基本”（在“基本情绪”中的意思）只是指原始的（进化意义上的基本）。</p> <p>但如果一种情绪是真正的基本情绪，它怎么可能有更基本的成分呢？ 比如惊讶。 我们可以将惊讶分为两种反应：一种是积极的兴趣和好奇感，另一种是消极的恐慌感。 既然惊讶由其他情绪组成，为什么还称它为“基本”情绪呢？</p> <p>原因在于“基本”并不意味着“没有成分”。</p> <p>事实上，复杂情绪在不同人、不同情境和不同文化中有很大的差异。 虽然悲伤常被认为是惊讶、否认、悲伤和愤怒的混合体，但在某些人或文化中，悲伤可能完全不同。 例如，有些人在失去时从不表现出愤怒。其他人则通过愤怒来表达悲伤。</p> <p>悲伤常被认为由惊讶、否认、讨价还价、恐惧、愤怒、悲伤和接受组成。 这些成分通常不会在悲伤的过程中同时出现，而是会按顺序发生，并且不一定是我刚才列出的顺序。 虽然悲伤可能涉及这些构建块，但它可以通过许多其他方式表现出来。 如果损失是预料之中的，惊讶可能就不是成分之一。如果你为一位亲人的去世而悲伤，悲伤可能不涉及否认或讨价还价。 相反，如果你为一场分手而悲伤，你可能会经历长时间的否认分手的现实，并激烈地与前任讨价还价。 悲伤还可能伴随情绪的变化，包括抑郁、绝望、忧郁、易怒或焦虑的感觉，以及个性外在特征的临时改变，例如向孤立、不安全感、情绪化和警觉性转变。</p> <p>复杂情绪可能因为在人、情境和文化中的不同精神状态混合而成，所以它们不会引发普遍可识别的面部表情。</p> <p><strong>原文链接: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201807/basic-and-complex-emotions">Basic and Complex Emotions</a></strong></p> <p><strong>版权所有：Berit Brogaard D.M.Sci., Ph.D</strong></p> <p><strong>本翻译仅供学习用途。</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="repost"/><category term="phycology"/><category term="emotions"/><category term="CHN Available"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cultural variation and evolutionary advantages.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What Are Basic Emotions?</title><link href="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/what-are-basic-emotions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What Are Basic Emotions?"/><published>2024-10-14T00:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-14T00:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/what-are-basic-emotions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/what-are-basic-emotions/"><![CDATA[<p>Neel Burton M.A., M.D. | Posted June 24, 2024 | Reviewed by Lybi Ma</p> <p>Emotions such as fear and anger are hardwired.</p> <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2> <ul> <li>Basic emotions are innate and automatic, and trigger behaviour with a high survival value.</li> <li>They evolved in response to the ecological challenges faced by our remote ancestors.</li> <li>Although they are ‘hardwired’, their potential objects are open to cultural conditioning.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201601/what-are-basic-emotions?msockid=3cc8053b5a536d851b73102d5b446c8c"> <img src="https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/styles/article_inline_full_caption/public/field_blog_entry_images/2024-06/Plutchik-wheel.svg_.png.jpg?itok=W_OEkWEY" width="480" height="auto" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1234"/> </a></p> <p>The concept of ‘basic’ or ‘primary’ emotions dates back at least to the Book of Rites, a first-century Chinese encyclopaedia that picks out seven ‘feelings of men’: joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, disliking, and liking.</p> <p>In the 20th century, Paul Ekman identified six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and Robert Plutchik eight, which he had in oppositional pairs (joy-sadness, anger-fear, trust-disgust, surprise-anticipation).</p> <p>Basic emotions are thought to have evolved in response to the ecological challenges faced by our remote ancestors and are so primitive as to be ‘hardwired’ into the brain, with each one operating along its own dedicated neurological circuit. Being hardwired, basic emotions (sometimes also called ‘affect programs’) are innate, automatic, and fast or reactive, and trigger behaviour with a high survival value.</p> <p>One day, while holidaying on the tropical island of Mauritius, I opened a cutlery drawer on a large lizard, which, of course, I had not been expecting to find in among the knives and forks. As the critter darted off into the darkness behind the drawer, I immediately and unthinkingly jumped back and slammed the drawer shut. Having done so, I suddenly became aware of feeling hot and alert and primed for further action. This basic fear response is so primitive that even the lizard seemed to share in it, and so automatic as to be ‘cognitively impenetrable’, that is, unconscious and uncontrollable, and more akin to a reflex or reaction than to a deliberate action. As soon as reason could reassert itself, my fear disappeared, leaving me with nothing more than a mildly inconvenient lizard problem, which, I think, I chose to ignore.</p> <p>One hypothesis is that basic emotions can function as building blocks, with more complex emotions being blends of basic ones. For instance, contempt might amount to a blend of anger and disgust. In 1980, Plutchik constructed a wheel-like diagram of emotions with eight basic emotions, plus eight derivative emotions each composed of two basic ones. However, many complex emotions cannot be deconstructed into more basic ones, and the theory does not explain why infants and animals do not share (or appear to share) in complex emotions.</p> <p>Instead, it could be that complex emotions are an amalgam of basic emotions and cognitions, with certain combinations being sufficiently common or important to be named in language. Thus, frustration might amount to anger combined with the thought or belief that ‘nothing can be done’. But again, many complex emotions resist such analysis. What’s more, ‘basic’ emotions can themselves result from quite complex cognitions, for instance, Tom’s blind panic upon realizing, or simply believing, that he has slept through an important exam.</p> <p>Although basic emotions have been compared to programmes, it does seem that their putative objects are open to cultural conditioning. If poor Tom so fears having missed his exam, this is in large part because of the value that his culture and sub-culture attach to academic success.</p> <p>With more complex emotions, it is the emotion itself (rather than its object) that is culturally shaped and constructed. Schadenfreude [German, lit. ‘harm-joy’: the joy or pleasure derived from the misfortune of another] is not common to all peoples in all times.</p> <p>Neither is romantic love, which seems to have emerged in tandem with the novel. In Madame Bovary, itself a novel, Gustave Flaubert tells us that Emma Bovary only found out about romantic love through “the refuse of old lending libraries.”</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Original Post: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201601/what-are-basic-emotions?msockid=3cc8053b5a536d851b73102d5b446c8c">What Are Basic Emotions?</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Copyright: Neel Burton M.A., M.D.</strong></p> <hr style="border: 2px solid;"/> <h1 id="什么是基本情绪">什么是基本情绪？</h1> <p>Neel Burton M.A., M.D. | 2024年6月24日 | 审阅：Lybi Ma</p> <p>恐惧和愤怒等情绪是天生固有的。</p> <h2 id="重点">重点</h2> <ul> <li>基本情绪是天生且自动的，它们会引发具有高度生存价值的行为。</li> <li>它们是在远古祖先面临的生态挑战中进化而来的。</li> <li>尽管它们是“硬连接”的，但其潜在对象可以受到文化条件的影响。</li> </ul> <p>“基本”或“主要”情绪的概念至少可以追溯到《礼记》，这本一世纪的中国百科全书列出了人的七种”情感”：喜、怒、哀、惧、爱、恶、欲。</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>译者注：</strong>《礼记·礼运》：“何谓人情？喜、怒、哀、惧、爱、恶、欲，七者弗学而能。”</p> </blockquote> <p>在20世纪，保罗·艾克曼（Paul Ekman）确定了六种基本情绪（愤怒、厌恶、恐惧、快乐、悲伤和惊讶），而罗伯特·普鲁奇克（Robert Plutchik）则提出了八种基本情绪，并将它们成对对立（如快乐-悲伤，愤怒-恐惧，信任-厌恶，惊讶-期待）。</p> <p>人们认为基本情绪是在远古祖先面临的生态挑战中进化而来的，它们是如此原始，以至于“根植于”大脑中，每种情绪都沿着其专属的神经通路运作。 由于是固有的，基本情绪（有时也称为“情感程序”）是天生的、自动的、快速或反应性的，能够引发具有高度生存价值的行为。</p> <p>有一天，当我在毛里求斯的热带岛屿度假时，我打开了一个装餐具的抽屉，发现了一只大蜥蜴，当然，我没想到会在刀叉中找到它。 当那只蜥蜴飞快地逃进抽屉后面的黑暗中时，我立刻不假思索地跳了回来并猛地关上了抽屉。 做完这一切后，我突然意识到自己感到身体发热、警觉，并为进一步的行动做好了准备。 这种基本的恐惧反应是如此原始，以至于连蜥蜴似乎都能共享这种反应；它是如此自发，以至于是“认知上无法理解的”，即无意识且无法控制，更像是一种反射或反应，而非有意的行动。 一旦理智重新占上风，我的恐惧随即消失，只留下了一个有点不便的蜥蜴问题，我想，我选择了忽略它。</p> <p>一种假设认为，基本情绪可以作为构建模块，更多复杂的情绪是基本情绪的混合。 例如，蔑视可能是愤怒和厌恶的混合体。 1980年，普鲁奇克构建了一个类似轮子的情绪图，展示了八种基本情绪，以及由两种基本情绪组合而成的八种派生情绪。 然而，许多复杂的情绪无法被分解为更基本的情绪，且这一理论无法解释为什么婴儿和动物没有（或似乎没有）复杂情绪。</p> <p>相反，复杂情绪可能是基本情绪与认知的融合，某些组合在语言中足够普遍或重要，以至于被命名。 因此，沮丧可能是愤怒加上“无能为力”的想法或信念。 但是，许多复杂的情绪仍然无法通过这种方式进行分析。 此外，“基本”情绪本身可能源自相当复杂的认知，例如，汤姆意识到或仅仅认为，自己错过了重要考试时产生的盲目恐慌。</p> <p>尽管基本情绪常被比作程序，但似乎它们的假定对象可以受到文化条件的影响。 如果可怜的汤姆如此害怕错过考试，很大程度上是因为他的文化和亚文化对学术成功的重视。</p> <p>对于更复杂的情绪，情绪本身（而非它的对象）是由文化塑造和构建的。 例如，<em>Schadenfreude</em>（德语，意为“幸灾乐祸”：从他人不幸中获得的快乐或愉悦）并非所有时代所有民族共有的情感。</p> <p>浪漫爱情也不是，它似乎伴随着小说的出现而产生。 在小说《包法利夫人》中，居斯塔夫·福楼拜告诉我们，艾玛·包法利是通过“旧借书店的废物”才了解浪漫爱情的。</p> <hr/> <p><strong>原文链接: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201601/what-are-basic-emotions?msockid=3cc8053b5a536d851b73102d5b446c8c">What Are Basic Emotions?</a></strong></p> <p><strong>版权所有：Neel Burton M.A., M.D.</strong></p> <p><strong>本翻译仅供学习用途。</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="repost"/><category term="phycology"/><category term="emotions"/><category term="CHN Available"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neel Burton M.A., M.D. | Posted June 24, 2024 | Reviewed by Lybi Ma]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">8 Sneaky Signs That Insecurity is Affecting Your Life and 5 Ways to Gain More Confidence</title><link href="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/8-sneaky-signs-that-insecurity-is-affecting-your-life-and-5-ways-to-gain-more-confidence/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="8 Sneaky Signs That Insecurity is Affecting Your Life and 5 Ways to Gain More Confidence"/><published>2024-10-13T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-13T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/8-sneaky-signs-that-insecurity-is-affecting-your-life-and-5-ways-to-gain-more-confidence</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/8-sneaky-signs-that-insecurity-is-affecting-your-life-and-5-ways-to-gain-more-confidence/"><![CDATA[<p>Ashley Laderer, John Mutziger | 29 March 2022</p> <ul> <li>Insecurity is the feeling that you are inadequate or not good enough.</li> <li>You might be insecure if you are self-critical, a perfectionist, or someone who self-sabotages.</li> <li>You can become more confident through therapy and practicing having compassion for yourself.</li> <li>Visit Insider’s Health Reference library for more advice.</li> </ul> <p>It’s normal to feel mildly insecure from time to time, such as before a first date or an important job interview. However, if you find yourself feeling insecure most of the time, and if it’s getting in the way of you living your day-to-day life, you may have more deeply rooted insecurities that need to be addressed in order for you to live your life happily and to the fullest.</p> <p>Here are eight signs that you’re insecure, and five ways to become more secure.</p> <h2 id="1-you-feel-inadequate">1. You Feel Inadequate</h2> <p>One of the main signs of insecurity is feeling inadequate, or that you aren’t good enough, says Courtney Glickman, PhD, LMHC, therapist and owner of The Collective Healing Center. Glickman says this can stem from negative experiences like childhood neglect, bullying, critical partners, or even societal expectations. “These experiences of powerlessness and judgment shape how individuals view their own self-worth and competency and often perpetuate shame,” says Glickman.</p> <h2 id="2-youre-a-perfectionist">2. You’re a Perfectionist</h2> <p>People who are insecure may be perfectionists and strive for flawlessness in order to make them feel more secure, Glickman says. However, perfectionism leads to unhealthy levels of self-criticism and a need for control, causing you to feel constantly let down and burnt out, says Glickman.</p> <h2 id="3-you-feel-a-lot-of-envy-or-jealousy">3. You Feel a Lot of Envy or Jealousy</h2> <p>When you’re insecure and feel inadequate, you may feel threatened or in competition with others, leading to envy and jealousy, Glickman says. This is because rather than focusing on themselves, insecure people tend to focus on comparing themselves to others, which may result in negative emotions.</p> <h2 id="4-youre-harsh-and-critical-of-yourself">4. You’re Harsh and Critical of Yourself</h2> <p>Regardless if your insecurity stems from something that happened in childhood or you developed it as an adult, it can manifest in the form of harsh self-criticism, says Jennifer Chain, PhD, licensed psychologist and owner of Thrive for the People. You might motivate yourself with self-criticism, guilt, or punishment. “If you find yourself talking to yourself in harsh or even abusive ways, you may be tearing yourself down regularly and contributing to your insecurity,” says Chain.</p> <h2 id="5-you-shape-shift-depending-on-who-youre-with">5. You Shape-Shift Depending on Who You’re With</h2> <p>You may see yourself as a social chameleon, Chain says. For example, you might change your mannerisms, speech, likes, and dislikes depending on who you’re around, since you may not be sure of who you truly are, or if people will like and accept the real you. “You may juggle different personas depending on the context and the people around you. You may be very skilled at this kind of shape-shifting, but it is costly and exhausting to keep up,” says Chain.</p> <h2 id="6-you-fear-rejection-and-abandonment">6. You Fear Rejection and Abandonment</h2> <p>In relationships, you might fear that you will be rejected or abandoned. “You may be constantly on the lookout for signs that the relationship is not going well, that the other person is unhappy with you, or you are failing somehow,” says Chain. This can result in you taking everything personally, interpreting your partner’s behaviors or statements inaccurately, reacting irrationally, or anticipating worst-case scenarios, Chain says, which can derail a relationship because you may become overly demanding, critical, or needy, creating conflicts that weren’t really there in the first place.</p> <h2 id="7-you-self-sabotage">7. You Self-Sabotage</h2> <p>“As a result of the fear of rejection or abandonment, your insecurity may show up as self-sabotaging behaviors,” says Chain. This can range from sabotaging your own personal success or your relationships. Chain says some examples of this may be:</p> <ul> <li>Procrastinating on a project because you’re afraid of failing despite giving your best effort.</li> <li>Acting cold or distant towards a partner because you are not sure how they feel about you.</li> <li>Avoiding asking for a promotion at work because you don’t think you’re deserving enough.</li> <li>Turning to emotional eating or drinking because you don’t feel like you deserve to be cared for.</li> </ul> <h2 id="8-you-dont-let-people-see-your-messy-side">8. You Don’t Let People See Your “Messy” Side</h2> <p>Nobody’s perfect, and everyone has flaws and moments of weakness. However, if you’re very insecure you may refuse to let anybody see those parts of you. “You may have learned growing up that your love and worthiness depend on presenting a perfect, have-it-all-together, and extremely competent image of yourself,” says Chain. This can lead you to have a hard time being vulnerable and letting people see you make mistakes, feel helpless, or cry.</p> <h2 id="what-to-do-about-insecurity">What to Do About Insecurity</h2> <p>Squashing your insecurities and becoming more secure with who you are and your abilities won’t be easy, but with hard work over time it’s possible. Here are five tips to become more secure and gain confidence.</p> <h3 id="1-seek-therapy">1. Seek Therapy</h3> <p>One of the best things you can do for yourself is to talk to a licensed mental health professional who can help you gain insight into issues that cause your insecurity. “Through therapy, individuals can build skills to foster a stronger sense of self, improve relationships, and develop coping skills to manage symptoms,” says Glickman. Many different types of therapy can address insecurity and help you learn new skills, but dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in particular is a type that Glickman recommends. “DBT is a wonderful approach that provides specific skills that focus on asking for what you want, saying no, and negotiating conflict without damaging the relationship,” says Glickman.</p> <h3 id="2-practice-self-compassion">2. Practice self-compassion</h3> <p>If you’re insecure, chances are you’re mentally beating yourself up often. Glickman suggests taking time to reflect and notice what you tend to judge and criticize about yourself. For example, is it your appearance, career, or relationships?</p> <p>The next time you notice you’re being overly self-critical, try switching up and speaking to yourself in a genuine, loving way, the same way you would to a close friend or family member. Remember to have compassion for yourself, as it’s been shown to help improve insecurity within relationships as well as overall mental health.</p> <h3 id="3-challenge-your-thoughts">3. Challenge your thoughts</h3> <p>A common component of therapy is learning to understand the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Glickman says you can work to challenge the negative, irrational beliefs leading to your insecurity.</p> <p>“Question, challenge, and don’t believe everything you think. This allows you to cognitively restructure unhealthy thinking patterns,” says Glickman. Over time, you will learn to quickly identify unhealthy thoughts and move forward in a healthier way.</p> <h3 id="4-be-your-own-loving-parent">4. Be your own loving parent</h3> <p>If your insecurity stems from your upbringing, it can help to do some inner-child work. “Imagine you have a small child inside of you. How would you speak to and treat your little self with kindness and tenderness? Close your eyes and imagine telling that little child that they are safe with you. You will protect them and care for them, and you love them,” says Chain. This draws from attachment theory, which is the idea that we learned our relationship behaviors early on in life based on our upbringing. Chain says this tip can be especially helpful if you had an unsafe or unpredictable relationship with your caretakers. This is also an aspect of different types of therapy such as psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy, internal family systems, and emotionally focused therapy, says Chain.</p> <h3 id="5-aim-for-progress-over-perfection">5. Aim for progress over perfection</h3> <p>Strive for realistic, attainable goals, keeping in mind that true perfection does not exist. “Focus on progress, which allows for more recognition of accomplishments and ultimately improves productivity and motivation,” says Glickman. Celebrate wins, no matter how small, along the way.</p> <h3 id="insiders-takeaway">Insider’s takeaway</h3> <p>Insecurity can show up in a lot of ways, ranging from feeling inadequate to fearing rejection to self sabotaging. Regardless of the cause of your insecurity, putting in work through therapy and other strategies can help you become more secure.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Original Post: <a

<p>不安全感的人可能是完美主义者，他们追求无缺陷的表现以让自己感到更有安全感，Glickman说。 然而，完美主义会导致不健康的自我批评和对控制的需求，使你感到不断失望和精疲力尽，Glickman指出。</p> <h2 id="3-你常感到嫉妒或羡慕">3. 你常感到嫉妒或羡慕</h2> <p>当你感到不安全并且觉得自己不够好时，你可能会觉得受到威胁，或与他人竞争，从而导致嫉妒和羡慕感，Glickman表示。 这是因为不安全感的人往往不专注于自己，而是将自己与他人比较，这可能会引发负面情绪。</p> <h2 id="4-你对自己非常苛刻">4. 你对自己非常苛刻</h2> <p>无论你的不安全感是来自童年经历，还是成年后发展出来的，它都可能以严厉的自我批评形式表现出来，持有执照的心理学家兼Thrive for the People的所有者Jennifer Chain博士指出。 你可能会通过自我批评、内疚或惩罚来激励自己。 “如果你发现自己对自己说话的方式过于苛刻甚至是虐待性的，你可能会经常贬低自己，进一步加剧你的不安全感，”Chain说道。</p> <h2 id="5-你会根据周围的人改变自己">5. 你会根据周围的人改变自己</h2> <p>你可能认为自己是个“社交变色龙”，Chain说。 例如，你可能会根据周围的人改变自己的行为、说话方式、喜好和厌恶，因为你不确定自己是谁，或者不确定别人是否会喜欢和接受真正的你。 “你可能会根据不同的情境和周围的人来扮演不同的角色。你可能非常擅长这种变换，但它会耗费大量精力并让你感到疲惫不堪，”Chain指出。</p> <h2 id="6-你害怕被拒绝和被抛弃">6. 你害怕被拒绝和被抛弃</h2> <p>在关系中，你可能害怕自己会被拒绝或被抛弃。 “你可能会时刻关注关系是否顺利，担心对方是否对你不满意，或者你是否在某些方面失败了，”Chain说。 这可能会导致你将一切都个人化，错误地解读伴侣的行为或言辞，做出非理性的反应，或预想最坏的情况，这会让一段关系偏离正轨，因为你可能会变得过于苛求、批评或依赖，从而制造原本不存在的冲突。</p> <h2 id="7-你会自我破坏">7. 你会自我破坏</h2> <p>“由于害怕被拒绝或被抛弃，你的不安全感可能会表现为自我破坏的行为，”Chain说。 这种行为可能包括破坏自己的个人成功或关系。 Chain举了一些例子：</p> <ul> <li>因为害怕尽全力后仍然失败，所以拖延一个项目。</li> <li>因为不确定对方的感受，所以对伴侣表现得冷漠或疏远。</li> <li>因为觉得自己不够格，所以不敢在工作中提出晋升要求。</li> <li>因为觉得自己不值得被照顾，所以会诉诸情感饮食或酗酒。</li> </ul> <h2 id="8-你不愿让别人看到自己混乱的一面">8. 你不愿让别人看到自己“混乱”的一面</h2> <p>没有人是完美的，每个人都有缺陷和软弱的时候。 然而，如果你非常不安全，你可能拒绝让任何人看到你的这些部分。 “你可能在成长过程中学到，爱与价值取决于你展现出的完美形象，即一切都在掌控之中且非常有能力，”Chain说道。 这可能会让你很难表现出脆弱的一面，或者让别人看到你犯错、感到无助或哭泣的样子。</p> <h2 id="如何应对不安全感">如何应对不安全感</h2> <p>消除不安全感并变得更加自信并不容易，但通过长期努力这是可以实现的。 以下是五个帮助你变得更有安全感并增强自信的建议。</p> <h3 id="1-寻求治疗">1. 寻求治疗</h3> <p>你可以为自己做的最好的一件事就是与持有执照的心理健康专家交谈，他们可以帮助你深入了解导致不安全感的问题。 “通过治疗，个体可以培养技能，建立更强的自我意识，改善人际关系，并学会应对症状的技能，”Glickman说道。 许多不同类型的治疗可以应对不安全感并帮助你学习新技能，Glickman特别推荐的是辩证行为治疗（DBT）。 “DBT是一种非常好的方法，它提供了具体的技巧，专注于如何提出需求、说‘不’以及在不破坏关系的情况下解决冲突，”Glickman说道。</p> <h3 id="2-练习自我关怀">2. 练习自我关怀</h3> <p>如果你不安全，可能你经常在心里责备自己。 Glickman建议花时间反思并注意你倾向于批评自己的方面。 例如，是你的外貌、职业还是人际关系？</p> <p>下一次你发现自己过度自我批评时，试着转换思路，用真诚、充满爱的方式与自己对话，就像你对待亲密的朋友或家人一样。 记住对自己要有同情心，因为研究表明，这有助于改善关系中的不安全感，以及整体心理健康。</p> <h3 id="3-挑战你的想法">3. 挑战你的想法</h3> <p>治疗的一个常见组成部分是学习理解思想、情感和行为之间的联系。 Glickman表示，你可以努力挑战导致不安全感的消极、非理性信念。</p> <p>“质疑、挑战，不要相信你想的每一件事。这可以帮助你在认知上重建不健康的思维模式，”Glickman说。 随着时间的推移，你会学会快速识别不健康的想法，并以更健康的方式前进。</p> <h3 id="4-成为你自己的爱心父母">4. 成为你自己的爱心父母</h3> <p>如果你的不安全感源自童年经历，做一些内在小孩的工作会有帮助。 “想象你内心有一个小孩。你会如何用善意和温柔对待这个小孩？闭上眼睛，想象告诉那个小孩，他们和你在一起是安全的。你会保护他们，照顾他们，并且你爱他们，”Chain说。 这源自依恋理论，即我们早期的养育方式塑造了我们在成年后的关系行为。 Chain表示，如果你在童年时期与照顾者的关系不安全或不可预测，这一方法会尤其有帮助。 这也是许多不同治疗方法的组成部分，如精神分析、心理动力治疗、内在家庭系统治疗和情感聚焦治疗，Chain指出。</p> <h3 id="5-追求进步而非完美">5. 追求进步，而非完美</h3> <p>努力追求现实的、可达到的目标，牢记真正的完美并不存在。 “专注于进步，这能让你更容易意识到自己的成就，并最终提高生产力和动力，”Glickman说道。 无论多么小的胜利都要庆祝。</p> <h2 id="insider的结论">Insider的结论</h2> <p>不安全感可能以多种方式表现出来，从感到自己不够好，到害怕被拒绝，再到自我破坏。 无论是什么导致了你的不安全感，通过治疗和其他策略的努力工作，可以帮助你变得更加自信。</p> <hr/> <p><strong>原文链接: <a

Lybi Ma</p> <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2> <ul> <li>Insecurity can be based on recent failures: Research shows up to 40% of one’s “happiness quotient” is based on recent life events.</li> <li>Social anxiety from being bullied or having critical parents can lead to insecurity.</li> <li>Perfectionism can cause insecurity, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and chronic fatigue.</li> </ul> <p>Do you find yourself filled with self-doubt and short on confidence? Despite your accomplishments, do you feel like a fraud destined to be exposed? Do you feel that you don’t deserve lasting love and that partners will inevitably leave you? Do you stay at home, afraid to venture out and meet new people because you don’t feel you have enough to offer? Do you feel overweight, boring, stupid, guilty, or ugly?</p> <p>Most of us feel insecure sometimes, but some of us feel insecure most of the time. The kind of childhood you had, past traumas, recent experiences of failure or rejection, loneliness, social anxiety, negative beliefs about yourself, perfectionism, or having a critical parent or partner can all contribute to insecurity.</p> <p>Following are the three most common forms of insecurity—and how to begin to cope with them.</p> <h2 id="type-1-insecurity-based-on-recent-failure-or-rejection">Type 1: Insecurity Based on Recent Failure or Rejection</h2> <p>Recent events can greatly affect both our mood and the way we feel about ourselves. Research on happiness suggests up to 40% of our “happiness quotient” is based on recent life events. The biggest negative contributor to happiness is the ending of a relationship, followed by the death of a spouse, job loss, and negative health events. Since unhappiness also influences your self-esteem, failure and rejection can deliver a double whammy to your confidence.</p> <p><strong>Below are some tools to overcome failure- or rejection-based insecurity:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Give yourself time to heal and adapt to the new normal.</li> <li>Get out and engage with life, following your interests and curiosity.</li> <li>Reach out to friends and family for distraction and comfort.</li> <li>Get feedback from people you trust.</li> <li>Persevere and keep moving towards your goals.</li> <li>Be willing to try a different strategy if necessary.</li> </ol> <h2 id="type-2-lack-of-confidence-because-of-social-anxiety">Type 2: Lack of Confidence Because of Social Anxiety</h2> <p>Many of us experience a lack of confidence in social situations like parties, family gatherings, interviews, and dates. The fear of being evaluated by others—and found to be lacking—can lead to feeling anxious and self-conscious. This type of insecurity is generally based on distorted beliefs about your self-worth and the extent to which others are evaluating you.</p> <p><strong>Below are some tools to combat insecurity in social situations:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Talk back to your inner critic. Remind yourself of all the reasons you can be interesting and fun or a good friend or partner.</li> <li>Prepare in advance. Think of things you can talk about—current events, movies, hobbies, your job, or your family.</li> <li>Avoiding social situations just makes things worse. So go to a party or on a date even if you’re nervous.</li> <li>Set yourself a limited, realistic goal. This could be anything from talking to two new people or finding out more about one person’s work and hobbies.</li> <li>Deliberately focus on others to combat intense self-focus. Put on your observer hat and notice what other people seem to be feeling and doing.</li> </ol> <h2 id="type-3-insecurity-driven-by-perfectionism">Type 3: Insecurity Driven by Perfectionism</h2> <p>Some of us have very high standards for everything we do. Life doesn’t always turn out exactly the way we want, even if we work extra hard. There is a piece of the outcome that is at least partly out of our control. If you are constantly disappointed and blaming yourself for being anything less than perfect, you will start to feel insecure and unworthy.</p> <p><strong>Below are some ways to combat perfectionism:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Evaluate yourself based on effort rather than outcome, which can be dependent on external factors.</li> <li>Think about how much difference it would actually make if your work were 10% better.</li> <li>Find the grey areas in all-or-nothing thinking. Is there a more compassionate way to view a situation?</li> <li>Focus on inner qualities like your character, sincerity, or good values, rather than just on external achievements.</li> </ol> <hr/> <p><strong>Original Post: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201512/the-3-most-common-causes-of-insecurity-and-how-to-beat-them">The 3 Most Common Causes of Insecurity and How to Beat Them</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Copyright: Melanie Greenberg, Ph.D., 2015.

As a result, it would be a little bit challenging to write down something without carefully thinking it.</p> <p>Some students might already have the capability of critical thinking before graduate school, but some might need to develop the skill when they are asked to write a formal article. For the second group, the first article can be a little bit painful, but no worry, it will be better and better.</p> <h1 id="balance-the-key-message-and-the-presentation-quality">Balance the key message and the presentation quality</h1> <p>Regarding the engineering papers, I would say people expect to learn something new from it. Otherwise, the article might be considered more of performance art, as it mainly shows the author’s superiority of intelligence or writing.</p> <p>Before writing, it is important to clarify what is the key message you want to deliver to the audience. Although people can have diverse opinions on what is interesting, convincing at least a few people is a good start.</p> <p>Once you determine the key message, you can start to write. However, the key message can change during the paper development, and it is okay to adjust the message as long as you feel it is exciting. The following book gives a good guide on how to write a paper in engineering:</p> <p><strong>H. B. Michaelson</strong>, <em>How to Write and Publish Engineering Papers and Reports</em>, 3rd edition, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1990.</p> <h1 id="common-mistakes-in-writing-ieee-papers">Common mistakes in writing IEEE papers:</h1> <p>There is a summary of the common mistakes in writing IEEE papers by <a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~tolbert/">Dr. Leon Tolbert</a>. The summary is informative and thus excerpted here for power engineering students.</p> <div> <ol> <li> Follow IEEE formatting for references: <br/> <div style="text-align: left;"> <img src="/assets/img/poster/IEEE_bib_format.png" alt="IEEE" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"/> </div> </li> <br/> <li> Format figures as follows. In the main text, it should read, “… as shown in Fig. 1.”<br/> <br/> Or, another example, “as seen by the waveform in Fig. 2(a), the voltage has significant harmonic content.”<br/> <br/> Figure captions should be formatted as follows:<br/> Fig. 1. Voltage waveform for the output of the dc-dc converter. </li> <br/> <li> After an equation, where you want to list what some of the variables are, the word “where” should be lowercase and at the left margin (not indented). Microsoft Word incorrectly will indent and capitalize. </li> <br/> <li> References should be inside [ ] and should be inside the period at the end of the sentence:<br/> <br/> Examples: “… and hence the amount of shunt compensation in the power system can be controlled [2].”<br/> <br/> “… with small effects on the dc link voltage [7, 9-11].”<br/> <br/> “Reference [8] provides information on how the …”<br/> </li> <br/> <li> Equations should be numbered in parentheses () and mentioned by number only without saying “Equation” or “Eq.” except at the beginning of a sentence:<br/> <br/> “… by substituting (3) into (1), the following expression is obtained.”<br/> <br/> “Equation (8) shows that torque is directly proportional to …”<br/> </li> <br/> <li> The unit should be abbreviated and follow the number separated by a space:<br/> <br/> Examples: 10 kW, 1200 V, 5.5 mA, 10 MHz, 300 °C, 20 s, 75 kHz.<br/> Wrong: 100W, 300C, 50 KHZ, 60 sec.<br/> </li> <br/> <li> Italicize symbols when used in the text:<br/> <br/> “… With reference to wind speed <i>v</i>, wind turbine radius <i>r</i>, turbine rotational speed <i>ω</i>, turbine sweeping area <i>A</i>, and air density <i>ρ</i>.” </li> <br/> <li> Do not use contractions in the paper (don’t, can’t, it’s, etc.). Instead, write out the words (do not, cannot, it is). </li> <br/> <li> Spell out abbreviations for the first time: “hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), pulse width modulation (PWM), insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)” </li> <br/> <li> Use a comma after introductory phrases: “With the increased use of non-linear loads on the utility, better metering and compensation techniques are needed...”<br/> <br/> "Before researching any new ideas on a subject, it is useful to look at current standards in the area."<br/> <br/> "For a single phase active filter using a voltage source inverter and coupling inductor, the limit cycle parameter after linearization are given by (24-25)." </li> <br/> <li> For a list of 3 or more items, separate by commas including before the word “and”.<br/> <br/> Example: “SiC devices have lower on-resistance, higher blocking voltages, and higher thermal endurance.” </li> <br/> <li> For a compound sentence (subject - verb, and subject - verb), separate by a comma.<br/> <br/> Example: “The IGBT and diode are soldered directly to the collector plate, and solder is used on each side of the spacers.”<br/> <br/> "Its function is limited, but its cost is low since it just makes a small improvement on the existing distribution transformers in the grid." </li> <br/> <li> Avoid using the following words (these are a little too simple and vague): <ol type="a"> <li>big</li> <li>got</li> <li>good</li> <li>bad</li> <li>problem</li> <li>“a lot” - use “several” or “many” instead</li> </ol> </li> <br/> <li> “Analysis” is a noun; “analyze” is a verb. </li> <br/> <li> Write papers in the third person. Do not use “you”, “we”, “us”, “our”. </li> <br/> <li> Do not use the words “firstly”, “secondly”, etc. Use “first”, “second”. </li> <br/> <li> Do not use the word “Besides…” to start a sentence. Instead, use “In addition…” or “Also…”. </li> <br/> <li> “Unbalanced” is preferred over “imbalance”. </li> <br/> <li> Capitalize the headings in papers, e.g., “A. Basic Converter Control” instead of “A. basic converter control”. </li> <br/> <li> Be specific in figure captions. It should say, “Fig. 10. MPPT control strategy for cascaded H-bridge multilevel converters used in wind generators.” and not “Fig. 10. Control strategy.” </li> <br/> <li> Be sure figures are fully labeled with units and identify what each waveform represents. </li> <br/> <li> Keep paragraphs short - about 4 to 5 sentences each; it makes the paper much more readable. </li> <br/> </ol> </div> <p>Note that some of the above rules are specific to IEEE papers and might not be applicable to other disciplines.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="writing"/><category term="research"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing is to know yourself]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Art and Science, The Difference Between Expression and Core</title><link href="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/art-and-science-the-difference-between-expression-and-core/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Art and Science, The Difference Between Expression and Core"/><published>2024-09-17T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-17T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/art-and-science-the-difference-between-expression-and-core</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/art-and-science-the-difference-between-expression-and-core/"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: left;"> <img src="/assets/img/poster/Moky.png" alt="Moky" style="width: 350px; height: auto;"/> <p><em>Moky in 2022</em></p> </div> <p>In the realms of art and science, the relationship between expression and core content shows significant differences. This perspective came to me during an English course, and recently, after a peculiar dream, I thought of an argument supporting this viewpoint.</p> <p>For art, even if the core idea remains the same, using different forms of expression can be considered innovative. Art carries human subjective emotions, and different forms of expression can trigger different emotional experiences.</p> <p>For example: Painting: The same theme can be expressed through oil painting, watercolor, sketching, etc., each bringing different visual effects and emotional resonance. Music: A pop song’s studio version, live concert version, and versions remade with different instrumental effects all provide different auditory experiences and emotional reactions. This diversity and innovation allow art to continually bring new feelings and inspirations to people.</p> <p>In contrast, science explores objective laws, and as long as the core idea is the same, it does not bring new knowledge. Scientific discoveries emphasize substance rather than form of expression. Here are some reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Objectivity of Science: Scientific discoveries need to convey information accurately, avoiding misunderstandings or ambiguities. Different forms of expression might lead to distortion or misunderstanding of information.</li> <li>Verification and Reproducibility: Scientific discoveries need to be verified and replicated to confirm their reliability. Different forms of expression might affect the reproducibility and verification process.</li> <li>Professional Audience: The audience for scientific discoveries is usually professionals who focus more on the substantive content and data rather than the form of expression.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, art and science show significant differences in the relationship between expression and core content. The diversity and innovation in art lie in its changing forms of expression, while the rigor and objectivity in science lie in its stable core content. Understanding this helps us better appreciate the unique charm of both art and scientific discoveries.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="culture"/><category term="opinion"/><category term="art"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moky in 2022]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What Is The Boundary Between Science and Engineering?</title><link href="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/what-is-the-boundary-between-science-and-engineering/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What Is The Boundary Between Science and Engineering?"/><published>2024-06-30T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-30T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/what-is-the-boundary-between-science-and-engineering</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/what-is-the-boundary-between-science-and-engineering/"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: left;"> <img src="/assets/img/poster/alpaca.png" alt="An alpaca in the Safari Park by Buxin She" style="width: 550px; height: auto;"/> <p><em>An alpaca in the Safari Park by Buxin She</em></p> </div> <p>As a Ph.D. student in the electrical engineering (to be more specific, power systems), I’ve been thinking the question posed in the headline recently. I’d like to share my thoughts about it.</p> <p>It arises from the research experience these years. Sometimes, after an idea is brought up, there might be a question “what’s new?” or “what’s the novelty?” It can occur in a paper review or a project meeting.</p> <p>I feel the motivation for novelty or something new, can be traced back to curiosity. Like the questions “why can fireflies light up”, or “why can the fireflies in Smoky Mountain synchronize?” When the answers to such questions are not directly relevant to practical concerns like paying rent, they can be regarded as <strong><em>Science</em></strong>, and they can bring joy. Conversely, if the answers can save people from tedious repetitive work, I would call it <strong><em>Engineering</em></strong>. Now, my answer to the question in headline is engineering is expected to make life better in a short period of time, while science is not expected to have immediate and direct implications on daily life. However, “novelty” itself is <strong>NOT BOUNDED</strong> to engineering or science.</p> <p>Here are some interesting answers I received recently:</p> <ul> <li>“Science is about the nature of the world, like the Newton’s laws of motion, or Maxwell’s equations. Engineering is about man-made things.”</li> <li>“Science is about why, and engineering is about how.”</li> <li>“Where science stops, engineering start.”</li> </ul> <p>Lastly, there’s a blog by Michael J. Black about the review process that I found interesting: <a href="https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/novelty-in-science">Novelty in Science</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="culture"/><category term="opinion"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An alpaca in the Safari Park by Buxin

This information is available at <a href="https://cge.utk.edu/2023/12/06/details-regarding-tennessee-law-sb-0834-hb-1445-a-k-a-tik-tok-ban-law/">Details regarding Tennessee Law -SB 0834/HB 1445 A.K.A “Tik Tok Ban Law”</a>.</p> <p>In the detailed second and third points, UTK clarified that it was the State of Tennessee, not the University of Tennessee, that created the law. Additionally, UTK claimed that the state legislation does not provide an exhaustive list of applications; the names mentioned are examples of known applications that are Chinese owned and operated.</p> <p>However, these details did not clearly answer the question of <strong><em>HOW</em></strong> those apps were determined to be “known applications” for a “social media platform” and <strong><em>WHO</em></strong> made these determinations.</p> <p>Jinning has tried to reach out to the campus leaders for further clarification.</p> <h2 id="nov-5-utk-leaders-met-with-university-members">Nov 5, UTK leaders met with university members</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/poster/meeting.jpg" alt="meeting" title="Campus Leaders' Meeting" style="width: 550px; height: auto;"/> Contact Jinning Wang at jwang175@vols.utk.edu if any copyright concerns.</p> <p>On <strong>November 5</strong>, <a href="https://chancellor.utk.edu/about-the-chancellor/">Chancellor Donde Plowman</a> and her <a href="https://chancellor.utk.edu/university-leadership/cabinet/">Cabinet</a> met with the invited university members to discuss the Tik Tok ban.</p> <p>At the beginning, attendees explored potential alternative apps and technologies that could be of assistance. Unfortunately, the discussion did not lead to any meaningful conclusions.</p> <p>Subsequently, campus leaders introduced their ongoing pilot project aimed at helping the impacted community stay in touch with their families and friends in China. This project is expected to take a couple of weeks to complete preliminary test.</p> <p>One suggestion from the students during the meeting was to consider providing financial support to the affected community as a means of mitigating the ban’s impact. However, campus leaders expressed concerns about whether university funding could be utilized in this manner.</p> <p>Additionally, Jinning Wang wondered a justification for the list of banned apps, as he had been advocating for this since the beginning. The campus leaders explained that both WeChat and TikTok had been explicitly mentioned during the legislative discussion, while other apps were added based on conventions followed by other institutions.</p> <p>In the end, Jinning Wang made two requests of the university: 1) A written report detailing the university’s involvement in the legislation process, internal discussions, and the criteria for app selection; 2) An email from the university expressing apologies to the impacted community for the lack of communication and demonstrating their support for the affected members.</p> <p>The campus leaders agreed to comply with both requests.</p> <h2 id="sep-6-cfaapi-met-with-the-utk-leaders">Sep 6, CFAAPI met with the UTK leaders</h2> <p>On <strong>September 5</strong>, <a href="https://diversity.utk.edu/cfaapi/">CFAAPI</a> leaders were invited to meet with the <a href="https://chancellor.utk.edu/about-the-chancellor/">Chancellor Donde Plowman</a> and her leadership team. In this context, CFAAPI forwarded Jinning Wang’s feedback to the campus leadership team.</p> <p>Jinning Wang’s letter is excerpted below, and he strongly advocates for the third mitigation measure, as he believes it will benefit the entire Volunteers:</p> <p>Dear University of Tennessee Campus Leaders,</p> <p>I would like to offer some suggestions regarding the recent Chinese app ban policy that has been implemented at our university.</p> <p>In light of the Chinese app ban policy, our university faces several potential challenges that merit attention:</p> <ol> <li>Compliance with State Government: As a subordinate institution to the state government, the university is obligated to follow government decisions, regardless of the decision’s nature.</li> <li>Lack of Awareness: Campus leaders may not be fully aware of the potential negative consequences associated with this policy.</li> <li>Lack of Precedence: The university may not have encountered similar issues in the past, leading to uncertainty in handling this situation.</li> <li>Lack of Appropriate Discussion with Impacted Communities: Adequate consultation and discussion with the communities affected by this policy may not have occurred, potentially leading to misunderstandings and concerns.</li> </ol> <p>To address these challenges, I propose several mitigation measures:</p> <ol> <li>Feedback Mechanism: To bridge the gap between the state government and the university’s operational realities, establishing a feedback mechanism can help convey the challenges and complexities faced by our institution due to the app ban.</li> <li>Task Force: Given the busy schedules of campus leaders, forming a dedicated task force comprising experts who can thoroughly analyze the policy’s impact and potential alternatives could be more effective and practical.</li> <li>Transparency through Reporting: Publish a comprehensive report detailing the timeline of the university’s involvement in the legislation process, internal discussions, and the criteria for app selection. This report would provide valuable insights to all volunteers and help create a more balanced policy.</li> <li>Suspending the Controversial Policy: Considering the potential negative impact and lack of convincing justification, it may be prudent to temporarily suspend the controversial policy until further convincing evidence or justifications are provided.</li> </ol> <p>Your dedication to ensuring the best interests of the university and its community is greatly appreciated. Thank you for considering these suggestions, and I look forward to seeing how we can collectively navigate this issue.</p> <p>Jinning Wang</p> <h2 id="may-5-cge-hosted-a-listening-session">May 5, CGE hosted a listening session</h2> <p>On <strong>May 5</strong>, <a href="https://cge.utk.edu/">Center for Global Engagement</a> hosted a listening session to support the Chinese community. In the session, university members from various backgrounds expressed their concerns and suggesstions, following excerpted part of commonts from listening session.</p> <p><strong><em>Comment 1: Passive UTK Leadership</em></strong></p> <p>I felt that the UTK leadership who participated in the Listening Session merely strived to explain their obligations in complying with the law. Unfortunately, this is a passive approach that shows the ineptitude of their leadership skill.</p> <p>The bigger question is that if they genuinely believe in diversity, equity and inclusion, and they aim to establish the Institute of American Civics with a goal of preventing social division, why wouldn’t they actively advocate and express their disagreement with such anti-Asian law?</p> <p>The UTK leadership did not show any willingness to do so, but merely whitewash their actions. This is called condescension to the AAPI community.</p> <p><strong><em>Comment 2: Poor Mobile Signal</em></strong></p> <p>Some people might say just use your own data if you cannot use WiFi in campus. But the thing is that in most school buildings, the signal is so poor. For example, when using mint mobile and now in student union, one can barely use phone network because there is no any signal.</p> <p>Then, the question is: is it possible for the university to improve the signal in the campus or provide a funding for the impacted community to transfer to other mobile operators with better service.</p> <p><strong><em>Comment 3: Possible Support</em></strong></p> <p>Technical support: OIT provides VPN download.</p> <p>Emotional support: Sending encouraging emails to students, faculty, and staff.</p> <p><strong><em>Comment 4: Disparity in User Numbers</em></strong></p> <p><em>Background</em></p> <p>Huge difference in number of users among TikTok and other Chinese apps. As we know, TikTok’s popularity exploded in the US in 2019 and 2020, with millions of users joining the platform and creating and sharing short videos. As of 2021, TikTok had over 100 million monthly active users in the United States.</p> <p>This number is based on data from the app analytics company App Annie and represents a significant increase from the approximately 40 million monthly active users TikTok had in the US in 2019. TikTok has become one of the most popular social media apps in the US, particularly among younger users</p> <p>However, the majority users of WeChat and other apps are located in China. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of the latest available data from 2020, the Asian population in Tennessee was estimated to be approximately 100,745, which represents about 1.5% of the state’s total population. However, it is important to note that the Asian population in Tennessee is not a homogeneous group and includes individuals from many different ethnic and cultural backgrounds.</p> <p>And the Chinese population in Tennessee was estimated to be approximately 12,070, which represents about 0.2% of the state’s total population. That means about 13% of total Asians in Tennessee may have Chinese background. According to the University of Tennessee’s Fact Book for Fall 2021, there were 1,066 international students enrolled at the university, and of those, 397 were from Asia. Let’s do a rough calculation, if we use the 13% times the 397, there are just about 52 students may have Chinese background.</p> <p><em>Q1</em></p> <p>Does it make sense to put WeChat, Sina Weibo, Tencent QQ, Tencent Video, Xiao HongShu, Douban, Zhihu, Meituan, and Toutiao at the same position on the same level of significance of TikTok considering the so called “National security concerns”?</p> <p><em>Q2</em></p> <p>Would the university of Tennessee consider this to be a form of segregation and unjust treatment of minorities of Chinese international students and staffs? Would University of Tennessee consider the potential impact of increasing community hatred towards Asian students? Are there any ways to handle those potential negative impacts?</p> <p><em>Q3</em></p> <p>This member shared a personal story, given privacy concern, this part was not displayed here.</p> <p>The third question is that: Is that possible for University of Tennessee to ban TikTok only in the campus instead of all the Chinese apps in the list?</p> <p><strong><em>Comment 5: Policy and Volunteer Spirit</em></strong></p> <p><em>Q1</em></p> <p>In the email from the IT department, it was mentioned that nine apps, including WeChat, Sina Weibo, Tencent QQ, Tencent Video, Xiao HongShu, Douban, Zhihu, Meituan, and Toutiao, were banned.</p> <p>However, it is not clear why these specific apps were selected for the ban. Could the university provide more information on the criteria used to determine which apps were banned as social media platforms?</p> <p><em>Q2</em></p> <p>The recent policy banning certain Chinese social media platforms has had significant impacts on certain groups of university members. However, there was no prior information or discussion with the university community before the ban was implemented.</p> <p>To ensure transparency in policy making and address the concerns of the affected community members, could the university provide information on the process by which this policy was developed and implemented?</p> <p><em>Q3</em></p> <p>Given the IT department’s quick implementation of the policy, it is important to ensure that the policy complies with the regulations and standards of the University of Tennessee.</p> <p>Is there a double-checking process in place to double-check the policy’s consistency with the university’s standards and regulations?</p> <p><em>Q4</em></p> <p>Tennessee General Assembly, the bill was signed by Governor on 04/13/2023. On 9:10 AM 04/14/2023, an email from the University, informed the implemented ban. On 3:PM 05/05/2023, a listening session to support Chinese community was held.</p> <p>Why was there a significant difference in response time between the legislation, which was responded to within 24 hours, and the university members, who had to wait 22 days for a response?</p> <p><em>Q5</em></p> <p>The Volunteer Spirit is a philosophy of service and leadership deeply ingrained in the University of Tennessee’s culture and history.</p> <p>This spirit is rooted in the region’s history of volunteerism and emphasizes the importance of giving back to the community through service and leadership. This philosophy extends beyond the university’s students to include its faculty, staff, and alumni.</p> <p>Alongside its technical innovations, the university’s unique character of Volunteer Spirit is a defining aspect of its identity. Through their dedication to giving back, the Volunteer family is changing lives for the better, in the city, state, country, and around the world.</p> <p>Today, we have some Chinese students, staff, and faculty attending this talk. These individuals have left their homes and crossed the Pacific Ocean to work and live here. Some will leave the university after completing their studies or work, going on to make a difference in the world with the knowledge and skills they gained here. However, the more important thing is the Volunteer Spirit that the university instills in its members.</p> <p>Now, there is a chance for the university to make a difference. Will the university seize this chance to show its commitment to service and leadership, or will it leave our Chinese colleagues alone, again?</p> <h2 id="may-3-jwang-shared-his-opinion-on-the-chinese-app-ban">May 3, J.Wang shared his opinion on the Chinese app ban</h2> <p>On <strong>May 3</strong>, Jinning Wang shared his opinion on the University of Tennessee’s Chinese app ban, <a href="https://www.utdailybeacon.com/opinion/guest_columns/opinion-on-chinese-app-ban-ut-can-comply-with-state-law-and-protect-individual-rights/article_105fa73e-e8f5-11ed-924c-67730fcda8d7.html">On Chinese app ban, UT can comply with state law and protect individual rights</a>.</p> <h2 id="apr-18-ut-daily-beacon-interviewed-on-the-impacted-community">Apr 18, UT Daily Beacon interviewed on the impacted community</h2> <p>Interview on the impacted Chinese community</p> <p>On <strong>April 18</strong>, the <a href="https://www.utdailybeacon.com">UT Daily Beacon</a> conducted a timely interview shedding light on the Chinese community directly impacted by the recent Chinese app ban.

<p><strong>12月6日</strong>，作为对王晋宁的要求的回应，CGE 提供了有关田纳西州法律SB 0834（HB 1445）的详细信息，也称为Tik Tok禁令法。这些信息可在<a href="https://cge.utk.edu/2023/12/06/details-regarding-tennessee-law-sb-0834-hb-1445-a-k-a-tik-tok-ban-law/">有关田纳西州法律SB 0834（HB 1445）的详细信息</a>中查看。</p> <p>在详细的第二和第三点中，UTK澄清，制定该法律的是田纳西州，而不是田纳西大学。此外，UTK声称，州立法并未提供应用程序的详尽列表；提到的名称只是已知的中国拥有和运营的应用程序的示例。</p> <p>然而，这些细节并没有清楚地回答这样一个问题：对于“社媒平台”来说，<strong><em>如何</em></strong>确定这些应用是“已知应用”，以及<strong><em>何人</em></strong>做出这些决定。</p> <p>王晋宁试图与校领导取得联系以获取进一步的澄清。</p> <h2 id="11月5日校领导与大学成员会谈">11月5日，校领导与大学成员会谈</h2> <p><strong>11月5日</strong>，校长 <a href="https://chancellor.utk.edu/about-the-chancellor/">Donde Plowman</a> 及其<a href="https://chancellor.utk.edu/university-leadership/cabinet/">内阁</a>与受邀的大学成员会面，讨论 Tik Tok 禁令。</p> <p>一开始，与会者探讨了可能有助于解决问题的潜在替代应用程序和技术。不幸的是，讨论没有达成任何有意义的结论。</p> <p>随后，校领导介绍了他们正在进行的旨在帮助受影响社区与其在中国的家人和朋友保持联系的试点项目。该项目预计需要数周时间来完成初步测试。</p> <p>与会期间，学生提出了一个建议，考虑提供财政支持来减轻禁令对受影响社区的影响。然而，校领导对于是否可以利用大学资金进行该项活动提出了担忧。</p> <p>此外，王晋宁对被禁应用名单的选取提出疑问，一如该事件开始时那样。 校领导解释说，立法讨论中明确提到了 WeChat 和 TikTok，而其他应用是根据其他机构的惯例添加的。</p> <p>最后，王晋宁提出了两项要求：1）提供一份详细说明大学在立法过程、内部讨论以及应用选择标准方面的明细；2）大学通过电子邮件向受影响社区表示道歉，表达对受影响成员的支持。</p> <p>校领导同意满足这两项要求。</p> <h2 id="9月5日cfaapi与校长及其领导团队的会议">9月5日，CFAAPI与校长及其领导团队的会议</h2> <p><strong>9月5日</strong>，<a

<p>王晋宁的信函如下节选，并且他坚持第三项弥补措施，因为他认为这将使全体志愿者受益：</p> <p>尊敬的田纳西大学校领导：</p> <p>我想就最近在我们大学实施的中国App禁令政策提出一些建议。</p> <p>考虑到中国App禁令政策，我们大学面临一些需要关注的潜在挑战：</p> <ol> <li>遵守州政府法规：作为州政府的从属机构，大学有义务遵守政府的决定，无论其性质如何。</li> <li>缺乏认识：校园领导可能未能充分认识到与这一政策相关的潜在负面后果。</li> <li>缺乏先例：大学可能以前没有遇到类似的问题，这可能导致在处理这种情况时伴有不确定性。</li> <li>与受影响群体缺乏适当的讨论：可能尚未与受该政策影响的社区进行充分的咨询和讨论，这可能导致误解和担忧。</li> </ol> <p>为解决这些挑战，我提出以下几项缓解措施：</p> <ol> <li>反馈机制：为了弥合州政府与大学实际运营之间的差距，建立反馈机制有助于传达由于App禁令而使我们单位面临的挑战和复杂性。</li> <li>工作组：鉴于校领导的繁忙工作日程，成立一个由专家组成的工作组，可以对政策的影响和潜在替代方案进行彻底分析，可能更加有效和切实可行。</li> <li>通过报告实现透明度：公开一份详尽的报告，详细描述大学参与立法过程的时间线，内部讨论以及App选择标准。这份报告将为所有志愿者提供有价值的见解，有助于制定更加平衡的政策。</li> <li>暂停有争议的政策：考虑到潜在的负面影响和缺乏令人信服的理由，暂时暂停有争议的政策可能是明智的，直到提供进一步令人信服的证据或理由。</li> </ol> <p>感谢您致力于确保大学及其社区的权益。感谢您考虑这些建议，期待我们共同解决这个问题。</p> <p>王晋宁</p> <h2 id="5月5日cge举行主题为支持中国社区的听证会">5月5日，CGE举行主题为支持中国社区的听证会</h2> <p><strong>5月5日</strong>，<a href="https://cge.utk.edu/">CGE</a> 举办了一场支持中国社区的听证会。 会上，来自不同背景的大学成员表达了他们的关注和建议，部分讨论内容如下：</p> <p><strong><em>评论1：学校领导团队的消极应对</em></strong></p> <p>在倾听会上，我感觉学校领导只是努力解释他们遵守法律的义务。遗憾的是，这种被动的方法显示出他们领导能力的不足。</p> <p>更重要的问题是，如果他们真的相信多样性、平等和包容，并且他们的目标是建立美国公民研究所以防止社会分裂，为什么他们不积极提倡并表达对这种反亚洲法律的反对？</p> <p>UTK领导并未表现出这样的意愿，只是粉饰他们的行为。这是对亚太裔群体的纡尊降贵。</p> <p><strong><em>评论2：糟糕的手机信号</em></strong></p> <p>有些人可能会说，如果你不能在校园里使用WiFi，就用你自己的数据。但问题是，在大多数学校建筑里，信号非常差。例如，在学生会堂使用mint mobile时，一个人几乎无法使用手机网络，因为几乎没有信号。</p> <p>那么，问题是：大学是否有可能改善校园内的信号，或者为受影响的社区提供资金，以便他们转到其他具有更好服务的移动运营商</p> <p><strong><em>评论3：可能的支持</em></strong></p> <p>技术支持：OIT提供VPN下载。</p> <p>情感支持：给学生、教师和员工发送鼓励性的电子邮件。</p> <p><strong><em>评论4：用户数量的差异</em></strong></p> <p><em>背景</em></p> <p>TikTok与其他中国应用程序之间的用户数量存在巨大差异。 众所周知，TikTok在2019年和2020年在美国的受欢迎程度激增，数百万用户加入平台，创作和分享短视频。截至2021年，TikTok在美国的月活跃用户超过1亿。</p> <p>这个数字是基于应用程序分析公司App Annie的数据，与2019年TikTok在美国的约4000万月活跃用户相比，有了显著增长。 TikTok已成为美国最受欢迎的社交媒体应用之一，尤其是在年轻用户中。</p> <p>然而，微信和其他应用的大多数用户位于中国。 根据美国人口普查局的数据，截至2020年的最新数据，田纳西州的亚裔人口估计为100,745人，占州总人口的约1.5%。 然而，值得注意的是，田纳西州的亚裔人口并非一个同质的群体，包括来自许多不同种族和文化背景的个人。</p> <p>田纳西州的华人人口估计为12,070人，占州总人口的约0.2%。 这意味着田纳西州约13%的亚洲人可能有中国背景。根据田纳西大学2021年秋季学期的事实手册，该校有1,066名国际学生入学，其中397名来自亚洲。让我们进行一个粗略的计算，如果我们用13%乘以397，就有大约52名学生可能有中国背景。</p> <p><em>问题1</em></p> <p>考虑到所谓的“国家安全问题”，将微信、新浪微博、腾讯QQ、腾讯视频、小红书、豆瓣、知乎、美团和头条与TikTok放在同一位置、同一重要程度上是否合理？</p> <p><em>问题2</em></p> <p>田纳西大学是否认为这是对华人国际学生和工作人员的一种隔离和不公正对待？ 田纳西大学是否考虑了对亚裔学生的社区仇恨可能增加的潜在影响？ 有没有办法处理这些潜在的负面影响？</p> <p><em>问题3</em></p> <p>这位成员分享了一段个人经历，为保护隐私，该部分不予显示。 第三个问题是： 田纳西大学是否有可能只在校园内禁止TikTok，而不是列表中的所有中国应用？</p> <p><strong><em>评论5：政策与志愿者精神</em></strong></p> <p><em>问题1</em></p> <p>在IT部门的邮件中提到，禁止了包括微信、新浪微博、腾讯QQ、腾讯视频、小红书、豆瓣、知乎、美团和头条在内的九款应用。</p> <p>然而，目前还不清楚为什么这些特定的应用被选为禁止之列。 大学能否提供更多关于用于确定哪些应用作为社交媒体平台被禁止的标准的信息？</p> <p><em>问题2</em></p> <p>最近禁止某些中国社交媒体平台的政策对一些大学成员群体产生了重大影响。 然而，在实施禁令之前，并未与大学社区进行事先的信息沟通或讨论。</p> <p>为确保政策制定的透明度，并解决受影响社区成员的担忧，大学是否能提供关于该政策是如何制定和实施的过程的信息？</p> <p><em>问题3</em></p> <p>考虑到IT部门对政策的快速实施，确保政策符合田纳西大学的规定和标准非常重要。</p> <p>是否有一个双重检查流程来确保政策与大学的标准和规定保持一致？</p> <p><em>问题4</em></p> <p>田纳西州议会，州长在2023年4月13日签署了这项法案。 2023年4月14日上午9:10，大学发出邮件通知实施禁令。 2023年5月5日下午3点，举行了一场支持中国社区的听证会。</p> <p>为什么在立法与大学成员之间的响应时间上存在如此显著的差异？立法得到24小时内的回应，而大学成员则不得不等待22天才得到回应？</p> <p><em>问题5</em></p> <p>志愿者精神是一种深深植根于田纳西大学文化和历史的服务和领导力理念。</p> <p>这种精神源于该地区志愿服务的历史，强调通过服务和领导力回馈社区的重要性。 这种理念不仅包括大学的学生，还包括其教职员工和校友。</p> <p>作为大学特色的志愿者精神与其技术创新并重，是其身份的决定性因素。 通过他们对回馈的奉献，志愿者们正在改变着不同城市、州、国家乃至世界各地人们的生活。</p> <p>今天，我们有一些中国学生、教职员工和教师参加了这次会谈。 这些人离开了家园，穿越太平洋来到这里工作和生活。 有些人将在完成学业或工作后离开大学，凭借在这里获得的知识和技能为世界带来变革。 然而，更重要的是大学在成员身上培养的志愿者精神。</p> <p>现在，大学有机会发挥作用。 大学会抓住这次机会展示其对志愿者精神和领导力的付出，还是会再次让我们的中国同事孤独无援？</p> <h2 id="5月3日王晋宁对ut中国应用禁令的观点">5月3日，王晋宁对UT中国应用禁令的观点</h2> <p><strong>5月3日</strong>，王晋宁发表了《关于中国应用禁令，田纳西大学可以遵守州法律并保护个人权利》，全文如下。</p> <p>SB0843于1月30日提交，旨在禁止向学生、教职员工或公众提供互联网接入的公立高等教育机构允许个人使用该机构的网络访问总部位于美国以外的公司拥有的视频平台。 然后，在3月2日，通过了对该法案的修正案1，将范围具体化为由中华人民共和国境内的公司运营或托管的社交媒体平台。</p> <p><strong><em>田纳西大学对TikTok法案的迅速反应</em></strong></p> <p>在州长 Bill Lee 于4月13日签署法案后，田纳西大学信息技术和创新副校长兼首席信息官 Ramon Padilla 代表田纳西大学，于4月14日发送了一封电子邮件，通知田纳西大学系统关于新实施的“TikTok法”。</p> <p>在未事先通知学生的情况下，田纳西大学在校园网络上封锁了微信、新浪微博、腾讯QQ、腾讯视频、小红书、豆瓣、知乎、美团和头条。</p> <p><strong><em>政策的潜在欠妥之处</em></strong></p> <p>尽管封锁某些社交媒体平台的政策可能是出于好意实施的，但这项政策有可能被认为是不当或令人担忧的。</p> <p>学校在缺乏事先通知与讨论讨论的情况下实施了这项政策，这使得学生与教职员工产生费解和沮丧。</p> <p>在实施该政策的决策过程中，缺乏透明度和包容性，这引发了对大学是否致力于在涉及他们的问题上与社区所有成员互动的担忧。</p> <p>为了促进更具包容性和透明度的决策过程，大学在政策制定和实施过程中积极与社区所有成员，特别是国际学生和学者互动至关重要。这将确保大学考虑到多元化的观点，并促进包容和公平的文化。</p> <p><strong><em>对法律的过度反应</em></strong></p> <p>相关法律旨在社交媒体平台，但大学的禁令涵盖了广泛的应用程序，却没有提供详细的理由。例如，微信主要是一种面向个人通信的私人消息服务，而不是社交媒体平台。</p> <p>按照美国国务院领事事务局的指导，来自中国的社交媒体平台包括豆瓣、Qzone（QQ）、新浪微博、腾讯微博和优酷。</p> <p>此外，该局指导申请人说：“请提供您想要列出的每个社交媒体平台的名称和相关的唯一社交媒体标识符（用户名或句柄）。这不包括像WhatsApp这样的面向个人通信的私人消息服务。”</p> <p>田纳西大学的禁令似乎是对仅涉及社交媒体平台的法律的不成比例反应。这尤其令人担忧，因为微信主要是一种私人消息服务，而不是像DS-160表格上列出的那些社交媒体平台。此外，缺乏对选定应用的明确理由引发了对依赖这些应用进行个人沟通的用户产生负面影响的担忧。</p> <p><strong><em>向田纳西大学发出呼吁</em></strong></p> <p>在对学校就最近封禁某些社交媒体平台的政策提出关注进行评估之后，我作为一名志愿者，强烈敦促田纳西大学采取行动，重新审视该政策。</p> <p>倾听社区成员的声音并以透明和包容的方式解决他们的担忧至关重要。重新评估政策可能涉及对其进行完善或修改，以确保其符合大学推动包容、尊重和多样性的价值观。</p> <p>虽然大学有义务遵守州法律，但同样重要的是保护个人权利，确保所有志愿者，包括特定群体的权利不受侵犯。</p> <p>大学可以探索更好的行动，以实现遵守州法律的义务与保护个人权利的义务的共存。</p> <p><strong><em>减轻负面影响</em></strong></p> <p>此外，作者呼吁大学积极努力减轻政策实施所产生的负面后果。</p> <p>这可能涉及修改政策，以确定校园内合理的禁用应用程序列表。为实现这一目标，大学应主动与受影响的学生和学者互动，了解影响的范围并相应地解决他们的担忧。</p> <p>另外，大学应探索为受政策影响的人提供替代资源和支持，例如提供补充援助和访问其他社交媒体平台的途径。</p> <p>通过采取这些措施，大学可以展示其对培养所有学生的热情和包容的学习环境的坚定承诺，无论他们来自哪个国家。</p> <p><strong><em>致谢</em></strong></p> <p>作为一名自豪的志愿者，作者感谢田纳西大学持续建设一个安全和包容的学术和学习环境。</p> <p>此外，作者感谢其他志愿者的帮助，包括但不限于《The Daily Beacon》的及时报道和CGE即将举行的支持中国社区的听证会。</p> <p>在我们努力寻求更加平衡的方式来解决各种关切时，我们承认并感激大学通过其政策和举措坚定地致力于培养一个多样化、公平和包容的社区。</p> <h2 id="4月18日对受影响华人群体的采访">4月18日，对受影响华人群体的采访</h2> <p><strong>4月18日</strong>，<a href="https://www.utdailybeacon.com">UT Daily
