It allows you to showcase your skills, achievements, and personality in a way that social media profiles can’t.</p> <p><strong>Disseminate Your Work.</strong> Many publishers permit authors to store a copy of their accepted manuscripts on personal websites. This can be a fantastic way to share your work with a broader audience, especially when access to the original publication is restricted by paywalls.</p> <p><strong>Share Your Thoughts Beyond Academic Publications.</strong> A personal website provides a platform to share ideas and thoughts that may not fit into academic publications. Whether it’s photography, travel, cooking, or any other passion, your website can be a space to express and share these interests with others.</p> <h1 id="how-to-build-it">How to Build It?</h1> <p>Building a website can be roughly divided into three steps: creating and editing content, hosting the website, and setting up a domain.</p> <p><strong>Step 1: Creating and Editing Content.</strong> Start by designing your website’s layout and adding content such as text, images, and any necessary functionality. This is where you bring your vision to life.</p> <p><strong>Step 2: Hosting the Website.</strong> Once your content is ready, you’ll need to host your website. This involves uploading your website files to a web server so that it can be accessed online.</p> <p><strong>Step 3: Setting Up a Domain.</strong> Finally, register a domain name and configure it to point to your web hosting server. This makes your website accessible through a unique web address.</p> <p><strong>One-Stop Solutions.</strong> If this process sounds daunting, don’t worry! There are services that provide one-stop solutions, such as GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, and Google Sites. For example, GitHub Pages allows you to create and host a website for free, with a domain like username.github.io. With many ready-to-use templates, GitHub Pages has become a popular choice for rookie website builders.</p> <p><strong>Commercial Services.</strong> Additionally, there are commercial services like Wix and WordPress that offer more advanced features and customization options. These platforms provide user-friendly interfaces and a wide range of templates to help you build a professional-looking website with ease.</p> <h1 id="some-examples">Some Examples</h1> <p>Below are some examples of personal websites, including those of academics, industry professionals, and artists.

height: auto;"/> <p><em>NBA Finals Game 1: Los Angeles Lakers v Boston Celtics</em></p> </div> <p>忽然间风云突变，陈总一跃而起，指着三分线外球员们大喊一声：补扣！</p> <p>我大惊失色，问陈总这如何补扣。</p> <p>陈总说，用腰腹。</p> <p>我说那他妈也不能跳这么远扣啊我操。陈总说，你看他们都长得跟猩猩似的，你看过人猿泰山吗，人都一跳好几棵树呢。</p> <p>我只好说陈总我不是那个意思，我只是觉得这样补扣的话不太好算分，容易给人家数据统计员造成一定的困扰。陈总翘起了两条美腿，撩了一下头发说我也觉得不太好算，那还是别勉强了吧。对，第二个奇特例子就是，陈总是个女的。</p> <p>这个年代，女球迷一旦出现，基本就是被男球迷活捉然后供奉起来的路子。尤其是陈总这种能侃的女球迷，尤其是陈总这种黑丝范儿的女球迷，尤其是陈总这种心上有篮球胸口也有篮球的女球迷。陈总有段时间特别爱找我说话，因为据她说，我是仅有的对她没有非分之想的男球友。当时我义正言辞地否认，说我是觉得我身为一个科黑，这是我的信仰，与你共存尚且值得商榷，谈何交配？陈总大怒，晃着两颗篮球指着我说你必须共存，我不管我不管我就是不管。我说好好好，共存共存，那交配呢？喜上眉梢的陈总说你夸夸科比我就考虑一下和你交配的事情，你要深情，要真挚，还要引经据典。我想了下说：</p> <p>“啪啪啪啪啪啪啪，鹰郡巨侠紫衫湿。”</p> <p>陈总说你讨厌死了你坏蛋而且一点儿都不押韵。我说这原来本身就不押韵啊，那我重新说一个？</p> <p>“好”。</p> <p>“一花一世界，一球一科比。”</p> <p>“滚。”</p> <p>我说那我夸夸你？</p> <p>“好”。</p> <p>“一球一科比，两球一个你。”</p> <p>智商堪忧的陈总笑着说你才是冰激凌呢。</p> <p>陈总喜欢科比的原因特别简单，因为她前男友喜欢。不幸的是，他前男友干事儿也有点儿像科比。比方说出轨。陈总发现后伤心欲绝，俩月后终于忍不住找我哭诉，眼泪从鹅蛋脸上一直流到乳沟。我说小陈没事儿咱不哭我介绍器大活儿好的高富帅给你好不好。她婉拒了我，说非要跟我出去喝一顿，于是当晚非拉着我睡一张床的陈总哭了个地动山摇。那晚我什么事儿都没干，一是因为科黑科密水火不容，二是因为就算想容，喝多了的她夹着腿嘴还不停地跟我说我想他，女人身上一共就这俩地方能让我干事儿，她还全巧妙地防御了起来。</p> <p>陈总那天晚上跟我学会了硬派这个词。她让我给硬派下个定义。我说就是高难度死忠，打游戏你看一般那种打一下就死了的都是硬派游戏。陈总说那你看我算硬派吗。我说凭你这身段去演A片应该算硬派，日一下就死了。然后当场发誓以后要变成硬派的陈总问我说，小唐啊你知道你为什么没女朋友吗。我说因为我长得丑，不像科比鹰郡人似月皓腕凝碳黑。陈总说不，因为你不喜欢科比。我说嘿卧槽你知道为什么你分手吗，因为你喜欢科比，你的人生最后会变成一场群P。陈总睁着没摘美瞳的眼睛问我说为什么。我说因为硬派的科比敢一个干五个。然后她嗷一声吐我一身。从那以后陈总就变成了一个硬派科密，连她男朋友的份儿都一起硬了，数据随便就能背出来，在张指导的带领下变成了一个动不动裁判草泥马你行你上啊的女人。</p> <p>但是我觉得吧，越硬派，她越会想起来她和他的科密男友一起看球的日子，一起在电视前鼓掌大叫，一起在绝杀后拥抱，一起在满场MVP的声音中接吻的日子。只因为每次一个好球，陈总转过脸想亲，却发现旁边经常是念叨着“哎哟我操还真进了”的我，然后脱下拖鞋砸向电视。陈总感叹，世界上最远的距离，就是一个好球我还无法和你击掌相庆。我说不，世界上最远的距离应该是你把科巨侠的球衣当情趣内衣穿，然后你汉子一下就软了。硬派的陈总总爱和我念叨交易这件事，甚至已经跨界到了足球界。有一阵子，只会分析胸罩该买多大的她执意要求切尔西用托雷斯换贝克汉姆。我说你怎么能这么换呢，足球没有这么换的，而且就算能换，你也不要用一个妞换我人生偶像。陈总说为什么不能换，都是人生赢家。你看一个有钱有冠军长得帅，一个没怎么踢拿着钱就把冠军集齐了。我说你怎么不用范冰冰换郭德纲呢，都是名角儿。陈总说，因为这俩都不够硬派，一切交易都只能给硬派。比如说只有乔丹才能单换科比。我说去你妈的你科巨侠有交易否决权岂能让你如此轻易地换了。</p> <p>有次陈总心血来潮，非要去浦东机场接我回西安。于是智商奇特的陈总不出意外的当晚就把我拉去杭州玩儿了。我俩在西湖那个外婆家排了两个小时的队，陈总感叹说这群人都是等着来上科比的吗。</p> <p>我说那你得数出来105个。陈总说你他妈能忘了黑科比这事儿吗。我说黑出了感情一时间放不下啊。我一直想告诉她，其实我一点儿都不讨厌科比，我早在漫长的黑科时光中和科比结下了深厚的情谊，只有我们高端黑才能黑科比，低端黑敢来，我们就黑回去。可我一直开不了口，因为这听起来挺像表白的，但我对陈总又没什么意思，所以这事儿最后不了了之。</p> <p>吃完我俩去西湖遛弯儿，大晴天的晚上月亮照在湖面上，颇有情调的陈总拽着我说她喜欢上个男的，要跟那男的表白，而且还要用古诗词。我说哎哟陈总你这是科密都要有文化了，来来来给我说哪一句古诗词。</p> <p>“山有木兮木有枝，心悦君兮知不知。”</p> <p>我迟疑了一下，问一脸期待的陈总：</p> <p>小陈，这到底有没有枝？</p> <p>陈总傻了，问我你说什么呢。</p> <p>我说山有木兮木有枝，到底你麻痹有没有枝啊？</p> <p>陈总硬派地拍着腿说我操山有木兮木有枝当然他妈有枝。</p> <p>我说不是你麻痹的木有枝吗！</p> <p>硬派的陈总差点儿把我踹下湖里去。</p> <p>此后漫长的时光里，我和陈总一起观看了许多场湖人的比赛，虽然我大部分的视线都随着时间一起在陈总胸口汹涌的流逝了。我曾建议陈总赶紧找个男朋友，别一天就跟我们这些汉子混迹，你看你虽然遇人不淑，但是科比这么铁命中率还有百分之四十六，你撒个网命中率肯定也不低。陈总说那你是说我要把你们男人灌醉了以后上了再好吗，犯规加罚，罚球命中率也高点儿。我统一说你丫身为一个硬派球迷，确实不应该来些文雅的，就应该直接点。但我忘记陈总除了是个硬派球迷外，还是个女人。</p> <p>前阵子陈总告诉我，她要嫁人了。我们喜闻乐见普天同庆奔走相告，庆祝老大难问题终于解决。结果正当我准备发表一番感言的时候，她说，你给我说一句你喜欢我我就不嫁了。我花了小半个小时才明白，原来山里那个木到底有没有枝一点都不重要。</p> <p>我说你个傻逼我才23岁我跟你玩儿这套干嘛，科黑和科密怎么互相结合。</p> <p>硬派的陈总说你不是喜欢我吗？我胸大。</p> <p>我说你胸大我也不喜欢你啊，想逃婚直接说，你看你傻逼了吧，别闹了傻逼咱俩谁跟谁啊你跟我玩儿这套。</p> <p>然后笑嘻嘻的我就被拉黑了。</p> <p>从没拉黑过人的陈总最终硬派了一次，和我站在了同一个篮球场上，却发现互为攻防双方。第四节最后5秒，陈总持球，一个回合定胜负。显然我在最后哨响时刻被陈总干脆利落的隔扣了。我以为这事儿已经完了，结果还吹了个2+1。因为二十分钟后陈总给我打来电话，说你给我唱个歌吧，唱你最讨厌的乐队的你最喜欢的歌，就跟你讨厌科比但是还得给81分跪下一样。</p> <p>我说好。我给你唱个硬派点儿的歌，你体会一下。</p> <p>“再也没有留恋的斜阳</p> <p>再也没有倒映的月亮</p> <p>再也没有醉人的暖风</p> <p>转眼消散在云烟</p> <p>那一天那一夜</p> <p>没有察觉竟已走远</p> <p>那一天那一夜</p> <p>从我的故事里走远”</p> <p>陈总问我，真他妈难听，这是什么歌。我说，西湖。说完我就挂了电话。</p> <p>我突然想起科比81分的那一天，还在上高中的我以为字幕打错了；我又想起三节六十二分的时候，我以为达拉斯只有四个人在场上；我想起09年10年我们一边下着注一边看着科巨侠虽千人吾往矣。</p> <p>原来硬派的真正定义就是，不管你讨厌他还是喜欢他，你硬是和电视上论坛上的他缠斗了小十年，根本没离开过。</p> <p>那时我以为，一代硬派球迷会就此在我的生活里退役。几天后，科比跟腿撕裂赛季报销。我想打个电话过去安慰一下陈总，可我觉得，硬派的陈总一定不会难受。那时我以为这就是结局了。可我没注意，陈总那个2+1，竟然只是和我打平。就像科比一样，你以为他完了，他总能站起来。你以为他老了，他还真敢接着铁。于是比赛就如此被拖入加时。过了一段日子，墨尔本开陈奕迅的演唱会，大半夜的我的电话响了我接起来，没有人讲话，只有那边演唱会的歌声，和一个女人一起唱歌的声音。我知道那是谁。那时我大概察觉到，我当初是喜欢她的，因为这么些年，我竟从未忘记过她的声音。但无奈开窍太晚，就算是科比也只能当尼克扬了。于是我就假装那是彩铃，一言不发等那首歌完。这次是她挂了电话。</p> <p>在这个陈奕迅已经烂大街、歌词用来当签名都会被拉黑的年代里，我一句话没说，竟然就这么参悟透了那句话：“应该怎么爱可惜书里从没记载，终于摸出来但岁月却不回来”。就像他终于知道该把谁追回来，却已经丢掉的太多。我不知道她为什么去了墨尔本，我也不知道她现在是什么样，但我知道她一定在很开心地活着。</p> <p>正如就算科黑如我，也一直相信科比每一次倒下，都会伴随着一次更加倔强地站起。毕竟硬派的人总要习惯人们在你的生活里来来往往，有人七进七出在你身上留下上百刀疤，有人一个回合把你斩于马下。而你依旧得站直了，接受MVP的高呼，纵使有时那听起来像是山海般呼啸的嘘声。</p> <div style="text-align: ;left;"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/Kobe_fifth_championship.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant's fifth and final championship" style="width: 300px;

Black | Published January 30, 2022</p> <p>Reviewers have strong ideas about what makes a paper acceptable in top conferences like CVPR. They know that getting into such conferences is hard and that getting a paper in is prestigious. So, the papers that get in must be really special. This is true, but what makes a paper special? A key focus of many reviewers is novelty. But what is novelty in science?</p> <p>I see reviewers regularly mistake complexity, difficulty, and technicality for novelty. In science reviewing, novelty seems to imply these things. We might be better served by removing the word “novelty” from the review instructions and replacing it with beauty.</p> <p>Beauty removes the notions of “technical” and “complex” and gets more to the heart of scientific novelty. A painting can be beautiful even if it is simple and the technical complexity is low. So can a paper. A little squiggle of paint by Picasso can be as beautiful as an intricate painting by Rembrandt.</p> <p>Keeping beauty in mind, let’s look at some common reviewer misunderstandings about novelty.</p> <h2 id="novelty-as-complexity">Novelty as complexity</h2> <p>The simplicity of an idea is often confused with a lack of novelty when exactly the opposite is often true. A common review critique is</p> <blockquote> <p>The idea is very simple. It just changes one term in the loss and everything else is the same as prior work.</p> </blockquote> <p>If nobody thought to change that one term, then it is ipso facto novel. The inventive insight is to realize that a small change could have a big effect and to formulate the new loss.</p> <p>Such reviews lead my students to say that we should make an idea appear more complex so that reviewers will find it of higher value. I value simplicity over unnecessary complexity; the simpler the better. Taking an existing network and replacing one thing is better science than concocting a whole new network just to make it look more complex.</p> <h2 id="novelty-as-difficulty">Novelty as difficulty</h2> <p>It’s hard to get a paper into a top conference, therefore reviewers often feel that the ideas and technical details must be difficult. The authors have to shed blood, sweat, and tears to deserve a paper. Inexperienced reviewers, in particular, like to see that the authors have really worked hard.</p> <p>Formulating a simple idea means stripping away the unnecessary to reveal the core of something. This is one of the most useful things that a scientist can do.</p> <p>A simple idea can be important. But it can also be trivial. This is where reviewers struggle. A trivial idea is an unimportant idea. If a paper has a simple idea that works better than the state of the art, then it is most likely not trivial. The authors are onto something and the field will be interested.</p> <h2 id="novelty-as-surprise">Novelty as surprise</h2> <p>Novelty and surprise are closely related. A novel idea is a surprising one by definition – it’s one that nobody in the field thought of. But there is a flip side to this as surprise is a fleeting emotion. If you hear a good idea, there is a moment of surprise and then, the better it is, the more obvious it may seem. A common review:</p> <blockquote> <p>The idea is obvious because the authors just combined two well known ideas.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obvious is the opposite of novelty. So, if an idea is obvious after you’ve heard it, reviewers quickly assume it isn’t novel. The novelty, however, must be evaluated <strong><em>before</em></strong> the idea existed. The inventive novelty was to have the idea in the first place. If it is easy to explain and obvious in hindsight, this in no way diminishes the creativity (and novelty) of the idea.</p> <h2 id="novelty-as-technical-novelty">Novelty as technical novelty</h2> <p>The most common misconception of reviewers is that novelty pertains to technical details. Novelty (and value) come in many forms in papers. A new dataset can be novel if it does something no other dataset has done, even if all the methods used to generate the dataset are well known. A new use of an old method can be novel if nobody ever thought to use it this way. Replacing a complex algorithm with a simple one provides insight.</p> <p>Novelty reveals itself in as many ways as beauty. Before critiquing a paper for a lack to technical novelty ask yourself if the true novelty lies elsewhere.</p> <h2 id="novelty-as-usefulness-or-value">Novelty as usefulness or value</h2> <p>Not all novel ideas are useful. Just the property of being new does not connote value. We want new ideas that lead us somewhere. Here, reviewers need to be very careful. It’s very hard to know where a new idea will take the field because any predictions that we make are based on the field as it is today.</p> <p>A common review I get is</p> <blockquote> <p>The authors describe a new method but I don’t know why anyone needs this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lack of utility is indeed an issue but it is very hard to assess with a new idea. Reviewers should be careful here and aware that we all have limited imagination.</p> <h2 id="a-personal-note">A personal note</h2> <p>My early career was built on seeing and formalizing connections between two established fields: robust statistics and Markov random fields. The novelty arose from the fact that nobody had put these ideas together before. It turned out to be a fertile space with many surprising connections that led to new theory. Fortunately, these connections also turned out to be valuable, resulting in practical algorithms that were state of the art.</p> <p>With hindsight, the connection between robust statistics and outliers in computer vision seems obvious. Today, the use of robust estimators in vision is the norm and seems no more novel than breathing air. But to see the connections for the first time, before others saw them, was like breathing for the first time.</p> <p>There is little in life more exciting than that spark of realization in science when you glimpse a new way of seeing. You feel as if you were the first to stand on a mountain peak. You are seeing the world for a moment the way nobody before you has ever seen it. This is novelty and it happens in an instant but is enabled by all of one’s experience.</p> <p>The resulting paper embodies the translation of the idea into code, experiments, and text. In this translation, the beauty of the spark may be only dimly glimpsed. My request of reviewers is to try to imagine the darkness before the spark.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Original Post: <a href="https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/novelty-in-science">Novelty in Science</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Copyright belongs to the original author.</em></strong></p> <hr style="border: 2px solid;"/> <h1 id="科学中的创新性">科学中的创新性</h1> <p>Michael J. Black | Published 2022年1月30日</p> <p>审稿人对顶级会议（如CVPR）接收论文的标准有着强烈的看法。他们知道，进入这样的会议非常困难，能够发表论文是一件很有声望的事情。因此，被接收的论文必须非常特别。这是事实，但究竟是什么让一篇论文显得特别呢？许多审稿人的一个核心关注点是“创新性”。但科学中的“创新性”到底是什么？</p> <p>我经常看到审稿人把复杂性、难度和技术性误认为是创新性。在科学评审中，创新性似乎隐含着这些特质。或许我们应该从评审指南中移除“创新性”这个词，并用“美妙”替代。</p> <p>美感排除了‘技术性’和‘复杂性’的概念，直击科学创新的核心。一幅画，即使简单且技术复杂性低，也可以很美。同样地，一篇论文也可以如此。毕加索的一小条涂鸦可以和伦勃朗的一幅复杂画作一样美。</p> <p>以美感为出发点，让我们来看看审稿人对创新性的常见误解。</p> <h2 id="将创新性等同于复杂性">将创新性等同于复杂性</h2> <p>人们常常将一个想法的简单性误认为缺乏创新性，而事实恰恰相反。一条常见的评审意见是：</p> <blockquote> <p>这个想法非常简单。它只是改变了损失函数中的一个项，其余部分和已有工作一样。</p> </blockquote> <p>如果没人想到要改变这个项，那它本身就具有创新性。创新性的洞察力在于认识到一个小的改变可能带来大的影响，并能将其转化为新的损失函数。</p> <p>这样的评审会导致我的学生认为，必须让想法显得更复杂，审稿人才会觉得更有价值。但我认为，简单比不必要的复杂更有价值；越简单越好。基于现有网络并替换某些部分，比为了显得复杂而设计一个全新网络更符合科学精神。</p> <h2 id="将创新性等同于难度">将创新性等同于难度</h2> <p>由于很难在顶级会议上发表论文，审稿人通常认为想法和技术细节必须是困难的。作者需要付出“鲜血、汗水和泪水”才能配得上一篇论文。特别是缺乏经验的审稿人，更希望看到作者经历了艰苦的努力。</p> <p>提出一个简单的想法意味着剔除不必要的部分以揭示核心。这是科学家最有用的能力之一。</p> <p>一个简单的想法可能是重要的，但也可能是琐碎的。审稿人在这里会感到挣扎。琐碎的想法是不重要的想法。如果一篇论文提出了一个简单但优于现有技术的想法，那它很可能并不琐碎。作者触及了一些有意义的东西，同领域的人会感兴趣。</p> <h2 id="将创新性等同于惊喜">将创新性等同于惊喜</h2> <p>创新性和惊喜密切相关。一个创新的想法定义上是令人惊讶的——它是领域中没人想到的。然而，惊喜是一种短暂的情绪。如果你听到一个好点子，最初可能会感到惊讶，但越是好的点子，可能越显得显而易见。常见的评审意见是：</p> <blockquote> <p>这个想法显而易见，因为作者只是结合了两个已知的想法。</p> </blockquote> <p>显而易见是创新性的对立面。因此，如果一个想法在你<strong>听到后</strong>显得显而易见，审稿人很快会认为它不具创新性。然而，创新性应该在想法出现之前被评估。创新的关键是首先提出这个想法。如果一个想法很容易解释，且事后看起来显而易见，这丝毫不会减弱其创造性（和创新性）。</p> <h2 id="将创新性等同于技术创新">将创新性等同于技术创新</h2> <p>审稿人最常见的误解是认为创新性与技术细节相关。一篇论文的创新性（及价值）可能以多种形式展现。例如，一个新数据集如果完成了其他数据集未能实现的目标，即便其生成方法是众所周知的，也可以是创新的。一个旧方法的新用途，如果以前从未有人这样使用，也可以是创新的。用简单算法替代复杂算法，能够提供新的见解。</p> <p>创新性可以以各种方式展现，就像美感一样。在批评一篇论文缺乏技术创新之前，问问自己真正的创新性是否体现在其他地方。</p> <h2 id="将创新性等同于实用性或价值">将创新性等同于实用性或价值</h2> <p>并非所有的创新想法都是有用的。仅仅是新颖本身并不意味着有价值。我们需要能带来新方向的新想法。在这里，审稿人需要非常小心。判断一个新想法会将领域带向何处非常困难，因为我们所有的预测都是基于当前领域的状态。</p> <p>我常收到的一条评审意见是：</p> <blockquote> <p>作者提出了一种新方法，但我不知道为什么需要这个。</p> </blockquote> <p>缺乏实用性确实是个问题，但很难对一个新想法进行评估。审稿人在这里需要小心并意识到，我们的想象力是有限的。</p> <h2 id="个人感悟">个人感悟</h2> <p>我的早期职业生涯是基于查看并形式化两个既有领域之间的联系：稳健统计和马尔可夫随机场。这种创新性来源于之前没有人将这些想法结合起来的事实。这是一个充满意外联系的肥沃领域，最终带来了新的理论。这些联系最终也证明是有价值的，产生了实用的、达到业界领先水平的算法。</p> <p>回头看，稳健统计与计算机视觉中离群值之间的联系似乎显而易见。今天，在视觉领域中使用稳健估计器已是常态，看起来与呼吸空气一样普通。然而，最初看到这些联系的时候，是在别人看到之前，就像第一次呼吸新鲜空气。</p> <p>科学中，没有什么比新发现的那一刻更激动人心了。当你发现一种新的视角时，你仿佛是第一个站在山顶上俯瞰世界的人。那一刻，你看到的世界与以往从未被人见过的视角相同。这就是创新性，它发生在一瞬间，但是由所有的经验所促成。</p> <p>最终的论文体现了将这一想法转化为代码、实验和文字的过程。在这个转化过程中，灵感的美感可能只能隐约可见。我对审稿人的请求是：试着想象火花出现前的黑暗。</p> <hr/> <p><strong>原文链接: <a href="https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/novelty-in-science">Novelty in Science</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>版权属于原作者，本翻译仅供学习用途。</em></strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="repost"/><category term="opinion"/><category term="research"/><category term="novelty"/><category term="CHN Available"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A guide for reviewers]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Power Systems Wiki</title><link href="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/power-systems-wiki/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Power Systems Wiki"/><published>2024-12-11T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-11T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/power-systems-wiki</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/power-systems-wiki/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2> <p>Language itself is inherently ambiguous, and the terminologies in power systems are no exception.

To be reliable, the power system must be secure most of the time. To be secure, the system must be stable but must also be secure against other contingencies that would not be classified as stability problems e.g., damage to equipment such as an explosive failure of a cable, fall of transmission towers due to ice loading or sabotage. As well, a system may be stable following a contingency, yet insecure due to post-fault system conditions resulting in equipment overloads or voltage violations.</li> <li>System security may be further distinguished from stability in terms of the resulting consequences.

The model resides and is maintained by the PJM staff on the PJM Energy Management System (EMS). The PJM EMS Network Application programs utilize the model to continuously calculate the <strong>real-time state</strong> and determine the <strong>security</strong> of the PJM system. The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) dispatches every generator in the model. The model is also used to calculate real-time Locational Marginal Prices. The model is created and maintained from input data received by PJM from various sources including Transmission Owners, Generation Owners, Load Serving Entities, and other Balancing Authorities. The model is only as accurate as the input data used to derive it; therefore, timely and accurate data updates are critical.</p> <p><strong><em>Thermal Limit Operation Criteria</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p29, Revision 67) PJM uses the following techniques to control contingency or system violations:</p> <ul> <li>Adjusting PARs.</li> <li>Switching reactive devices in/out of service or adjusting generator MVAR output.</li> <li>Switching transmission facilities in/out of service.</li> <li>Adjusting generation MW output via redispatch.</li> <li>Adjusting imports/exports.</li> <li>Issuing a TLR (Transmission Loading Relief).</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Voltage Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p40, Revision 67) High, Low, and Load Dump actual voltage limits, High and Low emergency voltage limits for contingency simulation, and voltage drop limits for wide area transfer simulations to protect against wide area voltage collapse.</p> <p><strong><em>Transfer Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p40, Revision 67) The MW flow limitation across an interface to protect the system from large voltage drops or collapse caused by any viable contingency.</p> <p><strong><em>Stability Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p40, Revision 67) is limit based on <strong>voltage phase angle difference</strong> to protect portions of the PJM RTO from separation or unstable operation.</p> <p><strong><em>Stability Limits</em></strong> by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m11"></d-cite> (p82, Revision 133) The ability of a generating unit or a group of generating units to maintain synchronism following a system disturbance can be identified using real time and study applications such as the PJM Transient Stability Analysis (TSA) tool.

For real power (MW) stability limits only, TO Connection <strong>stability limits will be translated into a corresponding generator output constraint</strong> (in MW) for a single generator or a group of generators.</p> <h2 id="adaquecy">Adaquecy</h2> <p><strong><em>Expected Unserved Energy (EUE)</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite> is a measure of the generation and transmission system’s capability to continuously serve all loads at all delivery points while satisfying all planning criteria. EUE is energy-centric and analyzes all hours of a particular year. Results are calculated in <strong>megawatthours (MWh)</strong>. EUE is the summation of the expected number of megawatthours of load that will not be served in a given year as a result of demand exceeding the available capacity across all hours. Additionally, this measure can be normalized based on the assessment area’s total Net Energy for Load. Normalizing the EUE provides a measure relative to the size of a given assessment area.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-Load Hour (LOLH)</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite> is generally defined as the number of hours per year where system demand will exceed the generating capacity. LOLH is usually expressed in <strong>hours per year</strong>. Any outage caused by inadequate resources regardless of geographic extent or load interrupted (it could be 1 MW for a single customer or the loss of the whole area load) counts as a LOLH. An LOLH of 0.1 means that an hour of loss of load is expected for every 10 years. For a particular year (e.g. 2014), the resources available and load shapes for that year are used to calculate the metrics for that year.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-load expectation (LOLE)</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite> is generally defined as number of days per year for which the available generation capacity is insufficient to serve the demand at least once during that day. This metric is not being reported as part of this assessment. A criterion of one day in 10 years is an often used standard for LOLE.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-load probability (LOLP)</em></strong> is the probability of system demand exceeding the generating capacity during a given period. If LOLP is the number of days on which there is expected to be a shortfall per year, it is the same as LOLE. However, other definitions of LOLP are also used.</p> <p><strong><em>Loss-of-load events (LOLEV)</em></strong> is the number of events in which some system load is not served in a given year. A LOLEV can last for one hour or for several contiguous hours and can involve the loss of one or several hundred megawatts of load. TRE-ERCOT is the only Assessment Area to provide this metric in its regional assessment.</p> <h2 id="operating-reliability">Operating Reliability</h2> <p><strong><em>Severity Risk Index (SRI)</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2020sri"></d-cite> (p5) is a <strong>daily metric</strong> where transmission loss, generation loss, and load loss events aggregate into a single value that indicates performance of the BES. The SRI values range from zero to 1000. Zero is a theoretical condition where no transmission, generation or load loss occurred during the entire day. To the corollary, a value of 1000 would represent a situation where every transmission, generation and load5 was lost during the entire day. The SRI was designed to be usable for the entirety of NERC as well as applied more granularly, such as at an interconnection level.</p> <p><strong><em>SRI</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2024sor"></d-cite> (p12) The SRI provides a quantitative measure that assesses the relative severity of the combined impact of load, generation, and transmission loss on the BPS daily and offers a comprehensive picture of the performance of the BPS, allowing NERC to assess year-on-year reliability trends.</p> <h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2> <p><strong><em>System flexibility</em></strong> <d-cite key="nerc2010flexible"></d-cite> (in Executive Summary on page I) is defined as the ability of supply-side and demand-side resources to respond to system changes and uncertainties. Flexibility also includes the ability to store energy for delivery in the future and the operational flexibility to schedule/dispatch resources in the most efficient manner.</p> <p><strong><em>Flexibility reserves</em></strong> <d-cite key="nyiso2024power"></d-cite> (p37) are an emerging concept for addressing variability and uncertainty on longer timescales than operating reserves and regulation service.

The metric will consider the instances of customer service interruptions that have been restored automatically without requiring human intervention to capture the value of technology solutions such as distribution automation, advanced distribution management system (ADMS), or microgrids, that minimize customer impacts. It will measure the number of reportable storms where recovery is favorable to threshold values divided by the total number of reportable storms.</p> <p><strong><em>Non-Storm Resilience Metric</em></strong> by IEEE <d-cite key="chiu2020resilience"></d-cite> (p13) This metric focuses on robustness and the ability to withstand events. It is designed to capture the total number of gray sky days (GSD) in a calendar year with no more than the threshold value of customer interruptions. The metric is measured in a percentage of GSDs that does not exceed the threshold value. The threshold value varies by utility size and is defined as the percentage of customer interruptions over the total customer base (e.g.,0.375% of the total number of customers). GSD excludes any calendar day with at least one reportable storm-related outage.</p> <p><strong><em>Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)-based metrics</em></strong> by DOE GMLC <d-cite key="chiu2020resilience"></d-cite> (p13): MCDA metrics generally try to answer the question, “what is the current state of the electric system’s resilience, and what enhances its resilience over time?” These metrics can be used to assess the system’s baseline resilience relative to other systems. They typically include categories of system properties beneficial to resilience, such as robustness, resourcefulness, adaptivity, and recoverability. The application of these metrics requires following a process to review to what degree these properties are present within the system under analysis. This usually involves collecting data through surveys, developing weighting factors, and performing calculations to obtain numerical scores. MCDA metrics are used to calculate a resilience index (RI) that accounts for about 1,200 attributes grouped in 350 categories to characterize system resilience.</p> <p><strong><em>Performance-based metrics</em></strong> by DOE GMLC <d-cite key="chiu2020resilience"></d-cite> (p13): performance-based metrics (also known as <strong><em>consequence-based metrics</em></strong>) are generally quantitative approaches for answering the question, “How resilient is my system?” These metrics interpret quantitative data that describe infrastructure performance during disruptive events. The required data can be collected from historical events, subject matter estimates, and computational infrastructure models. These metrics are suitable for benefit-cost and planning analyses because they measure the potential benefits and costs associated with proposed resilience improvements and investments. Resilience metrics need to include a measure of consequences and the relevant statistical probability from the probability distribution of those consequences.</p> <h2 id="transmission-expansion-and-interconnection">Transmission Expansion and Interconnection</h2> <p><strong><em>Transmission Expansion</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p4, Version 4.2): A transmission expansion is the <strong>addition or modification</strong> of facilities of the NYS Transmission System that may be proposed or initiated by an Eligible Customer, including a TO, under Section 3.7 of or Attachment P to the NYISO OATT.</p> <p><strong><em>Interconnection</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p28, Version 4.2): In the context of this manual, an interconnection refers to the connection of a new <strong>Generating Facility</strong>, Class Year Transmission Project, or <strong>Load</strong> to the NYS Transmission System; or to materially increase the capacity of, or make a material modification to the operating characteristics of, an existing Generating Facility (including a BTM:NG Resource) or Class Year Transmission Project that is interconnected to the NYS Transmission System or Distribution System (see definition of “Interconnection Request” and related capitalized terms in Attachment X and Attachment Z to the NYISO OATT).</p> <p><strong><em>System Impact Study (SIS)</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p16, Version 4.2), The purpose of the SIS is to evaluate the impact of the proposed transmission project on the reliability of the NYS Transmission System and if study results indicate that the project, as proposed, would result in any adverse impact on reliability or violations of reliability standards and identify any Network Upgrades that would be required to mitigate any such adverse impact(s) or violation(s).</p> <p><strong><em>Facilities Study</em></strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p21, Version 4.2), The main purpose and objective of the Facilities Study is to provide to the Customer good faith estimates of the cost and time to construct the new facilities identified in the SIS.</p> <h2 id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h2> <p><strong><em>Aleatoric (aka statistical) uncertainty</em></strong> <d-cite key="hullermeier2021aleatoric"></d-cite> refers to the notion of randomness, that is, the variability in the outcome of an experiment which is due to <strong>inherently random effects</strong>.</p> <p><strong><em>Epistemic (aka systematic) uncertainty</em></strong> <d-cite key="hullermeier2021aleatoric"></d-cite> refers to uncertainty caused by a <strong>lack of knowledge</strong> (about the best model).

CIM is widely used for data exchange of bulk transmission power systems and is now beginning to find increasing use for distribution modeling and analysis. By using a common model, utilities, vendors, and researchers from both academia and industry can reduce the effort and cost of data integration, and instead focus on developing increased functionality for managing and optimizing the smart grid of the future.</p> <p>A brief history of CIM can be found in <d-cite key="wollenberg2015cimhistory"></d-cite>.</p> <p>A sample CIM file can be found at <a href="https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy/tree/master/cimpy/examples/sampledata/CIGRE_MV">CIMpy - CIM data created with NEPLAN</a></p> <p>Two answers by Microsoft Copilot about CIM, RDF, UML, and XML, on 01-09-2025:</p> <p>The <strong>Common Information Model (CIM)</strong> is a <strong>standard</strong> developed by the electric power industry to facilitate the exchange of information about an electrical network. It is maintained as a UML model and defines a common vocabulary and basic ontology for modeling the components and measurements of power systems. The CIM is officially adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and is used to derive design artifacts like XML or RDF schemas for application integration. It supports various applications, including energy management systems, SCADA, and planning and optimization1.</p> <p>The <strong>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</strong> is a <strong>standard model</strong> for data interchange on the web. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), RDF allows for the representation of information about resources in a graph form. RDF uses triples, which consist of a subject, predicate, and object, to make statements about resources. This model is highly flexible and can represent complex relationships between data. RDF is often used in conjunction with other web standards like SPARQL for querying RDF data, and it supports various serialization formats such as RDF/XML, Turtle, and JSON-LD23.</p> <p>The <strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</strong> is a standardized general-purpose <strong>modeling language</strong> in the field of software engineering. UML provides a set of graphical notation techniques to create visual models of software-intensive systems. It includes various types of diagrams, such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use case diagrams, to represent different aspects of a system. UML is widely used for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. It helps in understanding, designing, and managing complex software projects45.</p> <p>The <strong>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</strong> is a <strong>markup language</strong> designed to store and transport data. XML allows developers to define their own tags and structure data in a platform-independent way. It is widely used for data interchange between different systems and platforms. XML documents are made up of elements defined by starting and ending tags, and they can include attributes to provide additional information about the data. XML is used in various applications, including web services, configuration files, and data exchange formats67.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <ul> <li>CIM: Standard for modeling power system components and measurements, used for data exchange in the electric power industry.</li> <li>RDF: Framework for representing information about resources in a graph form, used for data interchange on the web.</li> <li>UML: General-purpose modeling language for visualizing and documenting software systems.</li> <li>XML: Markup language for storing and transporting data, allowing for custom tag definitions and platform-independent data exchange.</li> </ul> <p>Summary of what CIM is not:</p> <ul> <li>CIM is not a programming language: It is a standard for modeling power system components and measurements.</li> <li>CIM is not a software application: It provides a common data model for information exchange but is not an executable program.</li> <li>CIM is not a database: While it can be used to define data structures, it is not a database management system.</li> <li>CIM is not a communication protocol: It defines data models and schemas but does not specify how data is transmitted between systems.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Common Format for Event Data Exchange (COMFEDE) for Power Systems</em></strong> <d-cite key="ieee2010comfede"></d-cite> This standard defines a common format for the data files needed for the exchange of various types of power network events in order to facilitate event data integration and analysis from multiple data sources and from different vendor devices. The flexibility provided by digital devices in recording network fault event data in the electric utility industry has generated the need for a standard format for the exchange of data. These data are being used with various devices to enhance and automate the analysis, testing, evaluation, and simulation of power systems and related protection schemes during fault and disturbance conditions. Since each source of data may use a different proprietary format, a common data format is necessary to facilitate the exchange of such data between applications. This will facilitate the use of proprietary data in diverse applications and allow users of one proprietary system to use digital data from other systems. <strong>A sample file is given in the source file.</strong></p> <p>Versions: Inactive</p> <ul> <li>Draft: PC37.239/D04, Mar 2010 - Dec 31, 2010</li> <li>Reserved: C37.239-2010 - Nov 11, 2010</li> <li>Draft: C37.239 - Jan 01, 2010</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Common Format for Transient Data Exchange (COMTRADE) for Power Systems</em></strong> <d-cite key="ieee1999comtrade"></d-cite> A common format for data files and exchange medium used for the interchange of various types of fault, test, or simulation data for electrical power systems is defined.

Especially when there are no external milestones or deadlines, I can experiment with different implementations and architectures to achieve better performance, rather than rushing to meet a release date.</p> <h1 id="open-source-as-economically-free">Open-source as Economically-Free</h1> <p>According to the definition of “open-source software,” it does not require royalties or other fees. However, I want to emphasize that while you may not pay monetarily, developing and maintaining open-source software still requires significant effort.</p> <p>Some support comes from non-profit foundations, some from research funding, and some from the passion of developers. I believe nothing is truly “free” nowadays, much like how we pay for better daylighting even though no one owns the sunshine. Respect to the contributors’ time and efforts, and contribute back when you are ready.</p> <h1 id="open-source-as-bug-free">Open-source as Bug-Free</h1> <p>There is no guarantee that any software is free of bugs. Whether software works as intended is often a matter of empirical judgment. The more the software is used, the more confidence we have in its results. The advantage of open-source software is that when it produces unexpected results, you have the option to inspect every detail, rather than passively waiting for customer support.</p> <p>There are some open source tools by the power systems community. Among them, MATPOWER is definitely a pioneer that lasts for more than 30 years. MATPOWER is so successful that when a project involves power flow and optimal power flow, the question often arises: “do your results match MATPOWER results?” It is so widely and extensively used that we don’t need to worry about its validity. However, for other younger projects, it is important be inclusive and patient for unexpected results.</p> <h1 id="open-source-for-research">Open-source for Research</h1> <p>Open-source software often provides unique advantages over commercial alternatives, especially in research. When developing a new algorithm or method, you may need to modify the software to suit your specific needs. Open-source software allows for this flexibility, enabling you to adapt and customize the code as required. In contrast, many domain-specific commercial software solutions do not prioritize such flexibility, limiting your ability to make necessary adjustments.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="opinion"/><category term="open-source"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is more than free of charge]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Laws of Emotional Mastery</title><link href="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/laws-of-emotional-mastery/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Laws of Emotional Mastery"/><published>2024-10-15T15:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-15T15:20:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/laws-of-emotional-mastery</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/laws-of-emotional-mastery/"><![CDATA[<p>By Noam Shpancer Ph.D. | Published May 4, 2021 | Last reviewed on August 16, 2022</p> <p>Life, goes the saying, is like a diamond—hard and beautiful. Many are experiencing the hardness of it quite acutely these days, in the form of stress, dread, and fatigue. Much of our success in navigating these difficult times depends on our mental health.</p> <p>People may visualize mental health as a place one arrives at or a treasure one possesses. But mental health is neither a destination nor a property. Rather, it is something you do—the practice of proper mind management.</p> <p>Your mind is a lot like a car: Both churn with energy; both can take you places; both can veer off course to devastating effect. Most important, the usefulness of both will depend in large part on how you handle them.</p> <p>Good driving is a process of constant adaptation characterized by high responsivity and requiring myriad specific skills: how to take a turn, merge into traffic, change lanes safely. Likewise, sound mental health is a process of constant adaptation, characterized by psychological flexibility—the ability to recognize and adjust your mindset and behavior to various situations so as not to callously hurt yourself or others, and so that you may continue to represent your values and pursue worthy goals in the face of distractions and obstacles.</p> <p>Like driving, the process of mental health requires its own set of specific skills. Here, the skills in question are those that let us manage well the products of the mind—our thoughts, emotions, and behavior. Psychological science provides some useful instructions for that purpose.</p> <h2 id="think-accurately">Think Accurately.</h2> <p>Lying in bed at night, you hear a sudden “thud” coming from downstairs. What do you feel? What do you do? Your subsequent emotion and action will depend on what you tell yourself—your interpretation of what the noise means. If you think, This is just snow falling from the roof, you’ll likely turn back to sleep unbothered. But thinking, A burglar is at my window, will get your heart racing and have you reaching for your phone or gun, depending on your politics.</p> <p>Cognitive psychology research over the past few decades has shown that our thoughts—beliefs and subjective interpretations—give rise to our emotions and behavior. Thinking, in other words, is important for our emotional state.</p> <p>One oft-repeated axiom of advice is that you should, therefore, strive to “think positively.” Positive thinking gets good press, and in proper doses it can be useful. Optimism, as the work of psychologist Martin Seligman and others has shown, can help us endure periods of hardship, bolster a sense of hope, and improve mood.</p> <p>Alas, positivity, while differing in content, is similar in process to negativity: Both are biases, and both obscure and distort the truth. Basing a response on anything other than the truth carries grave risks. If you’re falling, there’s no use in telling yourself that you’ve learned how to fly. Decisions guided by truth and facts are more likely to prove successful. Sound mental health is served best by accurate thinking.</p> <p>Thoughts are like viruses. Letting the wrong one into your system may cause harm. Bad thoughts—racism is one—have caused more damage than bad viruses. And they’re harder to eradicate.</p> <p>Accurate thinking amounts to an informal application of the scientific method—a process of refereeing between competing truth claims based on evidence. To develop accurate thinking skills, we must first appreciate that our brain’s operations rely on two central processes: control and automatic. Control processes are slow, effortful, and highly vulnerable to disruption; they demand concentration and full attention. Automatic processes are fast, robust against disruption, and do not require attention or concentration in order to operate successfully.</p> <p>Learning how to drive a car is a control process— effortful and demanding. But 10 years later, your driving has shifted to automatic—effortless and requiring no concentration. Such autonomous operations have an important evolutionary role: They free up energy and allow conscious attention, a limited resource, to focus on what is new. That permits us to keep up with the ever dynamic conditions of reality, the better to survive and thrive.</p> <p>Habits are automatic processes operating outside of awareness. This fact has two main implications. First, you cannot describe something well if you aren’t aware of it. The more automatic a process becomes, the less information is available to us about how it works—one reason great players are not often great coaches. Their playing, what they do over and over, has become automatized; they no longer have clear conscious knowledge of how they do it. Second, you cannot change what you’re not aware of. A habit in motion tends to stay in motion.</p> <p>Throughout our life we acquire “thought habits”—automatic ways of thinking about the world and ourselves. Functional thought habits—like good eating, sleeping, or driving habits—help us operate efficiently and safely. However, distorted thought habits—like poor eating, sleeping, or driving habits—will over time result in psychological pain and maladjustment.</p> <p>If, for example, you’ve developed a thought habit of believing that anything short of perfection is failure, then you are bound to judge yourself a failure often, thus experiencing psychic pain. Your actual problem is not imperfection—which is merely a condition of all humanity, excepting Beyoncé—but the distorted automatic belief that perfection is the only form of success.</p> <p>Distorted thinking habits are not usually adopted randomly or through some mind abnormality, but because they served a useful purpose at the time of their adoption. For example, after years of driving to your place of employment, you need not notice the road. The route has been automatized, allowing your thoughts to wander quite freely during your commute. It’s a fine, adaptive habit.</p> <p>But if your office is suddenly moved to a new location across town, the same old habit is rendered maladaptive. You’ll need to exert effort, pay attention, and use your control processes to learn a new route.</p> <p>Sound mind maintenance likewise requires identification and change of outdated and ineffective thinking habits. Doing this takes several steps. First, you need to become aware of your thinking habits. In other words, you need to think about your thinking in order to detect recurring patterns. You can do this by asking yourself such questions as, What am I telling myself right now? or What thoughts come up for me in these kinds of situations?</p> <p>The second step is to realize that your initial thoughts in a given situation are just old habits at work rather than truth revealed. Thoughts in general are not world events but mind events. They are not facts but hypotheses, conjectures about what may or may not be. As such, you can observe them dispassionately and with curiosity and choose whether to engage or let them drift by like clouds in the sky. Such detached awareness may sometimes in itself neutralize the corrosive effects of troubling thoughts.</p> <p>Becoming aware of a distorted thinking habit also allows you to change it. Awareness alone, however, is insufficient: Realizing a place exists doesn’t automatically get you there. You need not know why a habit arose, but to replace it you’ll need to challenge and engage actively with the old thought habit.</p> <p>To do so, you’ll want to first generate several alternative thoughts. Ask yourself, What else may be going on? What else may happen? What else can I tell myself here? Then, evaluate the different thoughts based on evidence. (Asking yourself, Which of these thoughts would I bet my life on, if I had to? may encourage your evidence search.) Finally, choose the thought that is supported by the best evidence. Then repeat that thought to yourself and act from it.</p> <p>Accurate thinking is like buying eyewear. You don’t just grab onto the first pair of glasses you see. Rather, you check out the merchandize, try on a few pairs, pick several viable candidates for purchase, compare them based on assorted criteria of evidence— fit, price, style, brand—and choose the most appropriate pair for you. As with your glasses so with your thoughts. It’s best to inspect and evaluate the merchandize before making a purchase.</p> <h2 id="neither-deny-nor-obey-emotionsaccept-them">Neither Deny nor Obey Emotions—Accept Them.</h2> <p>Emotions hold great sway over our lives, coloring and flavoring experience. That said, it is useful to remember that emotions, like thoughts, are mind events not world events, which means that we have much say in regulating them.</p> <p>Science has yet to fully decipher the nature, structure, and origins of emotional experience. What we do know is that, pragmatically, emotions constitute a type of data that is often useful for navigating the world. A measure of emotional arousal helps us learn new things and remember important events. A baby’s cry of distress effectively summons the caregiver’s attention. Fear keeps you off the dangerous edge of the cliff.</p> <p>However, as with data in general, two questions loom large over emotional experience: First, are the data any good, or are they incomplete, corrupt, or distorted in some important way? And second, what’s the best response, given the data?</p> <p>Psychological research from David Barlow and others has shown that mental distress often emerges not from emotional experience itself but from errors in emotion regulation—mistakes in handling the data. The first such common error is that of denial, whereby emotions are resisted, disallowed, or avoided. This happens when you tell yourself you’re not allowed to feel what you’re feeling. Feeling the jitters before a big presentation, you admonish yourself to not get anxious.</p> <p>The impulse to deny emotions, particularly negative ones, is understandable. Negative emotions are no fun, and we often associate them with negative events and outcomes that we wish to avoid or forget. In fact, research from George Vaillant and others has shown that a measure of conscious emotion suppression—choosing not to engage or talk about distressing feelings—is often a useful, healthy coping mechanism. Such suppression, however, entails awareness, acceptance, and a lack of fear in the face of the emotion.</p> <p>Denial, on the other hand, denotes a fearful unwillingness to feel. Attempts at denial are ineffective, for several reasons. First, one law of our internal architecture is that whatever you tell yourself you’re not allowed to feel or think, you’re already feeling and thinking. Pushing against emotion is thus futile, as ill-advised and as fatiguing as swimming against a riptide.</p> <p>Moreover, designating a certain emotion as forbidden, intolerable, or dangerous can make you hypervigilant about the very emotion you’re trying to deny. Constant vigilance about an impending negative experience becomes a negative experience in itself.</p> <p>Finally, habits of denying negative emotions may, over time, morph into “experiential avoidance,” a general tendency to avoid difficult internal experiences. Research from Steven Hayes and others has identified experiential avoidance as an underlying factor in much psychopathology, for several reasons.</p> <p>Life is an obstacle course even in the best of times. Keeping one’s bearings and achieving meaningful goals involve a willingness to face and overcome adversity. If your only response to difficulty is to back off, you’ll end up retreating from life itself. Inability to tolerate difficult emotion impoverishes your mental life.</p> <p>Avoidance is appealing because it brings quick relief. The human brain is biased toward favoring short-term calculations and immediate gratifications. Rewards that are placed within our reach loom larger than faraway consequences. The bucket of fat-drenched French fries is all the more enticing for being right here in front of me, while the looming heart attack is years in the future, dimly sketched in the mind. No wonder I reach for the fries.</p> <p>Life was once—in our species’ early environs—precarious, strictly a short-term proposition. Privileging immediate reward was adaptive. Our lives now are, with any luck, long term and require long-term strategies. Holding your breath works to keep you alive under water in the short term; it is not effective for long-term submersion. Likewise the habit of avoidance, effective in the short term, becomes maladaptive over time.</p> <p>Avoidance teaches you nothing but how to evade more, and therefore tends to metastasize with time. The more you avoid, the less competent, knowledgeable, and confident you become, and the less of life you can fully experience.</p> <p>The second common mistake in handling emotions may be called “emotional obedience.” We assume our emotions represent the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth and must therefore drive our actions: I’m scared, therefore I must run. I’m angry, therefore I must fight.</p> <p>Such emotionally driven behaviors are problematic because research has shown—and self-reflection will no doubt confirm—that our emotions often provide distorted, partial, and biased information. A roller coaster ride may produce genuine terror, but it presents no real danger, short of badly messed up hair. Things we fear more (airplanes, strangers) are often safer than things we fear less (cars, family members). Your drunken insistence that you feel fine to drive is another case in point.</p> <p>Even when they tell a true story, our emotions rarely capture the whole of it. How you feel about buying a house is important, but far from the only consideration in finding an abode. Budget, family size, neighborhood, market conditions, and available alternatives matter too, often more so.</p> <p>To properly regulate emotional data, we must refrain from either denying or obeying emotions. Instead, there’s a simple two-step process. The first step is acceptance. Emotions are, in a sense, internal weather, and it’s as advisable to accept the truth and fact of our emotions as we do the weather’s. If you’re anxious or sad, your best first move is to acknowledge and accept what you feel: I am human. Humans have emotions. This emotion is part of my experience right now.</p> <p>Acceptance confers benefits. It is a form of facing facts, like describing a difficult event in honest detail. Doing so may be hard, but it manifests your courage and builds your strength. In accepting your emotions, you are also accepting the truth of your situation—a base from which to fashion a successful response.</p> <p>Accepting emotion also negates the exhausting and futile effort involved in denial and affords you the opportunity to examine and get to know a part of your experience. Knowledge is power. Self-knowledge is self-empowering.</p> <p>Finally, accepting a negative emotion lessens its destructive potential. Caught in a riptide, your best move is not to resist but to let the current take you out to sea. Soon, the current will weaken and disperse, and you’ll be able to swim around it and back safely to shore.</p> <p>Acceptance does not imply blind emotional obedience. Rather, the next step in proper emotion management is to decide what to do with the emotion data. Once you acknowledge that it’s raining, it is still up to you to decide how to act vis-à-vis that fact.</p> <p>Emotions tend to be good consultants but lousy executives. We are well advised to consider their input but ill advised to let them take charge. Your emotions, in other words, should work for you, not the other way around. Luckily, emotional data are but one of multiple useful data sources to consult before deciding on a course of action.</p> <p>Your best move is to seek diverse consults from sources other than emotion before making important behavioral decisions. Such sources include your goals, values, experience, logic, knowledge of self and world, Google, and more. Having entertained the varied inputs, you can then make a well-considered (rather than emotionally driven) executive decision about your most sensible path forward.</p> <p>Consider an example: You’re driving to your daughter’s wedding when another driver cuts you off dangerously. Your anger flares, advising you to chase the driver down and retaliate. Your first correct move is to acknowledge your rage and its advice. Next, summon your other consultants: What’s your goal for this trip? What values are important for you to represent by your conduct? What are the odds for a productive highway confrontation? Then, make an executive decision about your best course of action.</p> <p>Odds are that you’ll recognize the folly of letting a stranger hijack this important day, that you will choose to honor your values (such as, say, nonviolence), and therefore politely decline anger’s advice and keep on your way. Your anger will have long dissipated by the time you’re wowing the inebriated wedding party with your fancy footwork on the dance floor.</p> <h2 id="tolerate-short-term-pain-to-avert-long-term-suffering">Tolerate Short-Term Pain to Avert Long-Term Suffering.</h2> <p>Which brings us to behavior, the domain where thoughts and emotions manifest most consequentially. The golden rule of healthy behavior management: Challenges exist. To be overcome they must be met. Enduring short-term discomfort is the necessary passport to long-term health and adaptation. Those who cannot tolerate acute temporary discomfort now condemn themselves to chronic suffering later.</p> <p>Of course, avoidant behavior is sometimes warranted, even necessary. It’s best to dodge, rather than confront, the oncoming train. But when avoidance is motivated by distorted thinking, emotional mismanagement, or our innate, dated distaste for delayed gratification and long-term calculations, then indulging it will prove destructive.</p> <p>Behavioral engagement, facing fears and challenges, is usually the better approach. It helps in several ways. First, it allows us to improve our understanding of the terrain and hone our skills. Many things we first perceive as difficult are not inherently hard but merely effortful because they’re new, and hence under control processes. Practice makes competence. And practice requires engagement.</p> <p>In addition, behavioral engagement tends to bring you into regular, productive contact with others, which may strengthen community ties and shore up your social support network. Human beings are social creatures. We thrive only in coherent, well-coordinated groups. Social connectedness is among the most powerful predictors of health, happiness and longevity. Engaging with others is a wise investment in your own well-being.</p> <p>Moreover, recent research by Mark Bouton, Michelle Craske, and others has shown that, unlike avoidance, the process of facing one’s fears lets new coping responses compete. It overrides earlier maladaptive habits when feared catastrophic predictions get refuted by actual benign experiences.</p> <p>Finally, behavioral engagement is useful because action begets emotion. Contrary to popular belief, the emotion-behavior link is reciprocal. At times, our actions may be emotionally driven. But other times, emotions are action driven.</p> <p>Just as feeling lusty may beget a couple’s make-out session, so will making out likely beget heightened lust (do try this at home). Our emotions often line up behind our actions. This is why, as David Ekers and others have shown, the practice of behavioral activation—intentionally engaging in activities one associates with positive memories and feelings—is an important part of effective treatment for mood disorders. The fastest, most reliable way to change how you feel is by changing what you do.</p> <p>In sum, doing basic mental health right entails practicing accurate thinking, emotion management, and behavioral engagement, while learning to tolerate short-term discomfort in the service of meaningful long-term goals and deeply held values. Such practice requires considerable effort and commitment, as do all things that matter. But the trouble is worth it because, to paraphrase my mother, at the end of the day, all you’ve got is your mental health.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Original Post: <a

如今，许多人正深刻体会到它的坚硬，以压力、恐惧和疲惫的形式显现出来。 在应对这些困难时期时，我们成功与否很大程度上取决于我们的心理健康。</p> <p>人们可能会把心理健康想象成一个可以到达的地方，或是一个拥有的宝藏。 但心理健康既不是一个目的地，也不是一种财产。 相反，它是一种行为——正确心智管理的实践。</p> <p>你的心智很像一辆汽车：两者都充满能量；两者都能带你到达不同的地方；但两者也都可能偏离轨道，带来毁灭性的后果。 最重要的是，它们的有用性在很大程度上取决于你如何处理它们。</p> <p>良好的驾驶是一种不断适应的过程，它以高度的应变能力为特征，并需要掌握众多特定技能：如何转弯、融入车流、或安全变道。 同样，健全的心理健康是一种不断适应的过程，它以心理灵活性为特征——即能够识别和调整你的心态和行为，适应不同的情况，不至于冷酷地伤害自己或他人，并且在面对干扰和障碍时，依然能体现你的价值观，追求有意义的目标。</p> <p>像驾驶一样，心理健康的过程也需要一套特定的技能。 在这里，这些技能是帮助我们妥善管理心智产物的能力——我们的思想、情感和行为。 心理学为此提供了一些有用的指导。</p> <h2 id="准确思考">准确思考</h2> <p>晚上躺在床上时，你听到楼下传来一声突如其来的“砰”声。 你有什么感觉？你会做什么？ 你接下来的情绪和行动取决于你对这声响的解释。 如果你认为“这只是屋顶上的雪掉下来了”，你可能会毫不在意地继续睡觉。 但如果你认为“有小偷在窗边”，你可能会心跳加速，拿起手机或者枪，具体取决于你的观念。</p> <p>过去几十年的认知心理学研究表明，我们的想法——信念和主观解释——会引发我们的情绪和行为。 换句话说，思维对我们的情绪状态非常重要。</p> <p>一种常听到的建议是“要积极思考”。 积极思考的确有它的好处，适量时是有用的。 正如心理学家Martin Seligman和其他人的研究所示，乐观能帮助我们度过艰难时期，增强希望感，改善情绪。</p> <p>然而，尽管内容不同，积极思考的过程却与消极思考相似：它们都是偏见，都会掩盖和扭曲真相。 基于任何非真相的反应都存在巨大的风险。 如果你正在坠落，告诉自己学会飞行是没有用的。 由真相和事实引导的决策更有可能成功。 健康的心理状态需要精确的思维。</p> <p>思维就像病毒一样。 错误的思维一旦进入你的系统，可能会造成伤害。 糟糕的想法——例如种族主义——比病毒造成的伤害还要大。 而且它们更难根除。</p> <p>精确思考相当于非正式应用科学方法——根据证据对不同的真相主张进行裁定的过程。 为了培养精确思维的能力，我们必须首先认识到大脑的运作依赖于两个核心过程：控制过程和自动过程。 控制过程是缓慢的、费力的，且极易受到干扰；它们需要集中注意力和全神贯注。 自动过程则快速、抗干扰，不需要注意力或集中精神也能成功运作。</p> <p>学习驾驶是一种控制过程——费力且要求严格。 但十年后，你的驾驶已经变成自动化的——毫不费力且无需集中注意力。 这种自动化操作具有重要的进化意义：它们解放了能量，让有限的注意力资源能够集中于新的事物，帮助我们应对现实中的动态条件，从而更好地生存和发展。</p> <p>习惯是无意识中运行的自动化过程。 这一事实有两大含义。 首先，如果你没有意识到某件事，你就无法很好地描述它。 过程越自动化，我们获得的关于其运作的信息就越少——这就是为什么伟大的运动员往往不是伟大的教练。 他们反复做的事情已经自动化，他们不再清楚地知道自己是如何做到的。 其次，你无法改变你没有意识到的东西。 一个处于运行中的习惯会继续保持下去。</p> <p>我们一生中形成了许多“思维习惯”——对世界和自我的自动化思维方式。 功能性思维习惯——比如良好的饮食、睡眠或驾驶习惯——帮助我们高效且安全地运作。 但扭曲的思维习惯——如糟糕的饮食、睡眠或驾驶习惯——随着时间的推移，会导致心理痛苦和适应不良。</p> <p>例如，如果你形成了认为“任何不完美都是失败”的思维习惯，那么你很可能会经常评判自己为失败者，从而体验到心理上的痛苦。 你真正的问题不是不完美——不完美只是全人类的普遍状态，除了碧昂丝——而是那个扭曲的自动化信念：认为完美是唯一的成功形式。</p> <p>扭曲的思维习惯通常并非随机形成的，也不是由于某种思维异常而产生的，而是因为它们在形成时曾有过有用的作用。 例如，经过多年开车去上班的经历，你不需要注意路况。 这条路线已经自动化，允许你在通勤时让思绪自由飘散。 这是一个很好的适应性习惯。</p> <p>但如果你的办公室突然搬到城镇的另一端，那么同样的旧习惯就变得不再适应。 你将需要努力，集中注意力，并使用控制过程来学习新的路线。</p> <p>健全的心理维护同样需要识别并改变过时和无效的思维习惯。 做到这一点需要几个步骤。 首先，你需要意识到自己的思维习惯。 换句话说，你需要思考自己的思维，以便检测到反复出现的模式。 你可以通过问自己一些问题来做到这一点，比如：“我现在在对自己说什么？”或“在这种情况下我有什么想法？”</p> <p>第二步是要认识到，在某个特定情境中的初始想法只是旧习惯的作用，而不是被揭示的真理。 一般来说，想法不是世界事件，而是心智事件。 它们不是事实，而是假设，是对可能发生或不发生事情的推测。 因此，你可以以一种超然的、好奇的态度观察它们，并选择是否参与其中，或让它们像天上的云一样飘过。 这种超然的觉察有时本身就能中和那些困扰性思维的腐蚀性影响。</p> <p>意识到一个扭曲的思维习惯也使你能够改变它。 然而，仅有觉察是不够的：意识到某个地方存在并不会让你自动到达那里。 你不需要知道习惯是如何产生的，但要替代它，你需要积极地挑战和对抗旧的思维习惯。</p> <p>为此，你需要首先生成几种替代性思维。 问自己：“还有其他什么可能正在发生？”、“还有其他什么可能会发生？”、“在这里我还可以对自己说些什么？” 然后，根据证据来评估这些不同的想法。 （问自己：“如果必须的话，我愿意拿命来赌哪个想法？”或许会促使你寻找证据。） 最后，选择那个由最佳证据支持的想法。 然后不断对自己重复这个想法，并根据它采取行动。</p> <p>精确思维就像买眼镜。 你不会随便拿起第一副眼镜就买。 而是会检查商品，试戴几副，选择几个合适的候选，基于证据（如合适度、价格、款式、品牌等）进行比较，最终选择最适合你的那副。 你的眼镜如此，你的想法亦然。 最好在“购买”之前检查和评估“商品”。</p> <h2 id="既不否认也不服从接受情绪">既不否认也不服从——接受情绪</h2> <p>情绪对我们的生活有极大的影响，为我们的经历增添了色彩和味道。 但需要记住的是，情绪和思想一样，都是心智事件，而非世界事件，这意味着我们在调节情绪方面有很大的自主权。</p> <p>科学尚未完全解开情绪体验的本质、结构和起源。 但我们知道的是，从实用的角度来看，情绪是一种数据，通常在应对世界时非常有用。 一定程度的情绪激动可以帮助我们学习新事物并记住重要事件。 婴儿的哭声有效地吸引了看护者的注意。 恐惧则让你远离悬崖的危险边缘。</p> <p>然而，正如任何数据一样，情绪体验也面临着两个重要问题： 首先，这些数据是否可靠，或者它们是否在某种重要方面不完整、被破坏或歪曲？ 其次，鉴于这些数据，最好的回应是什么？</p> <p>心理学家David Barlow等人的研究表明，心理痛苦往往不是由情绪体验本身引起的，而是源于情绪调节的错误——也就是处理数据的错误。 第一个常见的错误是“否认”，即抗拒、拒绝或回避情绪。 这发生在你告诉自己不允许感受某种情绪时。 例如，在一个重要演讲前感到紧张时，你责备自己不该焦虑。</p> <p>否认情绪的冲动，尤其是负面情绪，是可以理解的。 负面情绪不令人愉快，我们常将它们与负面的事件和结果联系起来，并希望避免或忘记这些情绪。 事实上，George Vaillant等人的研究表明，一定程度的有意识情绪抑制——选择不去参与或讨论令人痛苦的情感——常常是一种有用且健康的应对机制。 然而，这种抑制需要意识、接受，并且不惧怕面对情绪。</p> <p>另一方面，否认则意味着一种对情绪的恐惧和不愿感受。 试图否认情绪是无效的，原因有很多。 首先，我们的内在结构中有一条规律：无论你告诉自己不允许感受或思考什么，你已经在感受和思考了。 抗拒情绪因此是徒劳的，就像逆着强流游泳一样不明智且令人疲惫。</p> <p>此外，将某种情绪标记为“禁忌”、“不可容忍”或“危险”可能会让你对正试图否认的情绪保持高度警觉。 对即将到来的负面体验的持续警惕本身就变成了一种负面体验。</p> <p>最后，否认负面情绪的习惯可能会随着时间的推移演变成“体验性回避”，即一种回避困难内心经历的普遍倾向。 Steven Hayes等人的研究发现，体验性回避是许多心理病理学的潜在因素，有多个原因导致这种现象。</p> <p>即使在最好的时候，生活也是一场障碍赛。 保持方向并实现有意义的目标需要愿意面对和克服逆境。 如果你面对困难时的唯一反应是退缩，你最终将逃避整个生活。 无法忍受艰难情绪会让你的心理生活变得贫乏。</p> <p>回避之所以吸引人，是因为它能迅速带来缓解。 人类大脑倾向于偏爱短期计算和即时满足。 摆在我们眼前的奖励比遥远的后果更为吸引人。 一桶油炸薯条就在我面前，这使它更具诱惑力，而未来几年后的心脏病发作则是模糊的、难以想象的。 难怪我会伸手去拿那桶薯条。</p> <p>在我们这一物种的早期环境中，生活是短期的，不稳定的。 优先考虑即时奖励是适应性的。 而现在的生活——如果幸运的话——是长期的，需要长期策略。 在水下屏住呼吸可以在短期内让你活下来，但对于长时间潜水来说，这不是有效的策略。 同样，回避的习惯在短期内有效，但随着时间的推移就会变得不适应。</p> <p>回避不会教会你如何应对，反而会让你学会更多地逃避，因此回避行为会随着时间的推移而扩散。 你回避得越多，你就变得越不称职、越缺乏知识和自信，你能真正体验到的生活也就越少。</p> <p>处理情绪时的第二个常见错误可以称为“情绪服从”。 我们假设情绪代表着真相、全部的真相，并且必须驱动我们的行为：“我害怕，所以我必须逃跑。” “我生气了，所以我必须战斗。”</p> <p>这种情绪驱动的行为是有问题的，因为研究表明——通过自我反思你也会确认——我们的情绪往往提供的是扭曲的、片面的、带有偏见的信息。 坐过山车时的恐惧可能是真实的，但实际上并没有真正的危险，除了可能弄乱了发型。 我们更害怕的东西（比如飞机、陌生人）往往比我们不那么害怕的东西（比如汽车、家人）更安全。 你喝醉后坚持自己状态良好、可以开车就是一个明显的例子。</p> <p>即使情绪讲述了一个真实的故事，它们也很少能展现事情的全貌。 你对买房子的感受固然重要，但在选择住所时，这并不是唯一的考虑因素。 预算、家庭规模、社区、市场状况以及其他可选方案都同样重要，往往更重要。</p> <p>要恰当地调节情绪数据，我们必须避免否认情绪或服从情绪。 相反，有一个简单的两步过程。 第一步是接受。 情绪在某种意义上是内在的天气，我们对待情绪的态度应该像对待天气一样，接受它们的真实和事实。 如果你感到焦虑或悲伤，最好的第一步就是承认并接受你的情绪：“我是人类，人类有情绪。这种情绪是我目前体验的一部分。”</p> <p>接受带来好处。 它是一种面对事实的方式，就像诚实地描述一件困难的事件。 这样做可能很难，但它展现了你的勇气，并增强了你的力量。 通过接受你的情绪，你也接受了你所处情境的事实，这为你成功应对提供了基础。</p> <p>接受情绪也消除了否认情绪所需的使人疲惫不堪的、徒劳的努力，并为你提供了机会去审视和了解自己的一部分经历。 知识就是力量。 自我认知就是自我赋能。</p> <p>最后，接受负面情绪减少了它的破坏性潜力。 陷入激流时，最好的做法不是抵抗，而是让水流把你带到海里。 很快，水流就会减弱并散去，你就能绕过它安全地游回岸边。</p> <p>接受并不意味着盲目服从情绪。 相反，情绪管理的下一步是决定如何处理情绪数据。 一旦你承认下雨了，还是由你来决定如何应对这个事实。</p> <p>情绪往往是好的顾问，但却是糟糕的执行者。 我们应考虑情绪的建议，但不应让它们掌控一切。 换句话说，你的情绪应该为你服务，而不是你为情绪服务。 幸运的是，情绪数据只是多个有用数据源之一，我们可以在做出行为决策前参考其他数据。</p> <p>在做重要决策前，你的最佳做法是从情绪以外的来源寻找多样化的建议。 这些来源包括你的目标、价值观、经验、逻辑、对自我和世界的了解、以及谷歌等等。 在吸收了多种意见后，你可以做出经过深思熟虑的（而非情绪驱动的）决策，找出最合理的行动路径。</p> <p>举个例子：你正在开车去参加女儿的婚礼，这时另一辆车危险地从你面前插了进来。 你的愤怒情绪燃起，建议你追上这辆车报复。 正确的第一步是承认你的愤怒以及它的建议。 接着，传唤其他顾问的：你这次旅行的目标是什么？你希望通过自己的行为表现哪些价值观？高速路上的对峙有多大可能是有效的？ 然后，做出关于最佳行动方案的决策。</p> <p>你很可能会认识到让一个陌生人劫持这重要一天的愚蠢之处，选择尊重你的价值观（例如，非暴力），因此礼貌地拒绝愤怒的建议，继续前行。 等到你在舞池上用华丽的舞步让醉酒的婚礼宾客惊叹时，你的愤怒早已消散。</p> <h2 id="忍受短期痛苦以避免长期痛苦">忍受短期痛苦以避免长期痛苦</h2> <p>这就引出了行为问题，这是思想和情绪最能展现影响力的领域。 健康行为管理的黄金法则是：挑战存在。 要克服它们，就必须面对它们。 忍受短期的不适是实现长期健康和适应的必要通行证。 那些现在无法忍受短暂的急性不适的人，最终将自己置于长期痛苦之中。</p> <p>当然，回避行为有时是合理的，甚至是必要的。 面对迎面而来的火车，最好是躲开，而不是迎面相对。 但当回避行为是由扭曲的思维、情绪失调或我们与生俱来的、已经过时的对延迟满足和长期规划的厌恶所驱动时，纵容这种行为将会带来破坏性后果。</p> <p>行为上的参与，即面对恐惧和挑战，通常是更好的方法。 它的好处有很多。 首先，它让我们更好地了解环境并磨练我们的技能。 许多我们最初认为困难的事情，并非天生就难，而是因为它们是新的，因此需要控制性过程来完成。 练习带来能力。 而练习需要参与。</p> <p>此外，行为参与往往能让你与他人保持定期、富有成效的接触，这可能会加强社区联系并巩固你的社会支持网络。 人类是社会性生物。 我们只有在协作良好、组织有序的群体中才能茁壮成长。 社会连接是健康、幸福和长寿的最强有力的预测指标之一。 与他人的互动是对自己健康的明智投资。</p> <p>此外，Mark Bouton, Michelle Craske等人的最新研究表明，面对恐惧的过程让新的应对反应得以竞争。 当人们预测的灾难性后果被实际的良性体验所推翻时，它会取代早期的不适应习惯。</p> <p>最后，行为参与之所以有用，是因为行动能产生情绪。 与普遍看法相反，情绪与行为的联系是双向的。 有时我们的行为是由情绪驱动的，但在其他时候，情绪是由行为驱动的。</p> <p>就像感受到欲望可能会引发情侣的亲热行为，而亲热行为反过来也可能会增加欲望一样（确保是在家中尝试确）。 我们的情绪往往会跟随我们的行为。 正因如此，正如David Ekers等人所展示的那样，“行为激活”实践——有意识地从事与积极记忆和感受相关的活动——是有效治疗情绪障碍的重要部分。 改变情绪最快、最可靠的方法就是改变你的行为。</p> <p>总而言之，正确的心理健康实践包括准确思维、情绪管理和行为参与，同时学习忍受短期不适，以实现有意义的长期目标和深植于心的价值观。 这种实践需要大量的努力和投入，正如所有重要的事情一样。 但这种努力是值得的，因为，借用我母亲的话来说，到了最后，你所拥有的就是你的心理健康。</p> <hr/> <p><strong>原文链接: <a

I never wanted to hit bottom that hard ever again and decided to learn everything I could about resilience and mental wellness.</p> <p>I started working as a coach over a decade ago, helping busy, overwhelmed women create more balanced, meaningful lives. Almost every client has some sort of work-related stress they need help with. Over the last few years, most are either on the edge of burnout or in the throes of severe work-related depletion.</p> <p>Many are so fed up that they hire me to help them ditch their current position and find something else.</p> <p>If possible, I counsel clients to wait and try smaller changes first. If you’re suffering from true burnout, you’re emotionally and mentally exhausted and not in a good zone to make life-altering decisions.</p> <p>Here’s what I advise clients to do:</p> <p><strong>1. Identify what’s causing you the most stress, and see if there’s a solution.</strong></p> <p>Maslach and Leiter, leading researchers on the subject of burnout, determined that there are six areas of work-life that can lead to burnout: excess workloads, lack of control, insufficient rewards, workplace community issues, unfair practices, and value conflicts.</p> <p>I’m working with a client who exhibits almost all the signs of burnout. She’s seriously considering leaving her position, though she used to love her work and still loves the company. In cases like hers, I’m concerned that thoughts of leaving are almost exclusively burnout-related.</p> <p>Some very specific issues are pushing her over the edge. Rather than sending in her resignation, she asked her superiors if they could make key changes. They highly value her and have agreed to respond to her requests. If they do, the positive impact will be significant, and far more convenient than having to chase down new work.</p> <p><strong>2. Stop doing work that’s not yours.</strong></p> <p>Excess workloads are one of the most common causes of burnout. When I ask clients where they might be able to cut back, the usual response is “Nowhere!” My next question: “Is there anything you’re doing at work that’s really someone else’s responsibility?”</p> <p>There almost always is. Highly conscientious people are at high risk for burnout, and they’re usually doing other people’s work. They want to help (rescue) others, or have a hard time saying no. Or perfectionism has entered in: The other person won’t do the task as well as they can, even though it’s not their responsibility.</p> <p>If you’re overwhelmed with work, look at everything you’re doing, and then get rid of anything you don’t actually have to do.</p> <p><strong>3. Place hard boundaries between work and the rest of your life.</strong></p> <p>Another client feels extremely stressed and burdened by her job, with little to no time for herself. She starts early, works long hours, and usually works into the evening at home. She doesn’t actually have to, but she feels continually pressured and ends up working in her off hours by default.</p> <p>When I asked her what she might do about this, her response was immediate: “I can leave my laptop at work! That way when I’m at home, I’ll be forced to do something else.” Perfect. I’ve had other clients do similar things, such as putting their work phone in a drawer—not to be touched—over weekends.</p> <p>How might you draw clearer boundaries between work and home?</p> <p><strong>4. Start taking care of yourself physically.</strong></p> <p>If you’re getting less than seven hours of sleep a night, you’re likely to feel exhausted and fried. If you’re skipping breakfast, mainlining espresso and grabbing junk food all day to keep yourself going, you’ll be sure to feel awful and perform even worse. If you sit at a desk all day without breaks and never get any exercise, it’s not surprising that you feel irritable and stressed.</p> <p>If you’re scrimping on sleep, not eating properly, or hardly moving at all in a given day, this is good news to me as a coach, because I know that as soon as you begin to get more regular sleep, eat better, and get moving, you’ll feel dramatically better. You might even start liking your job again.</p> <p>As I always say, if you feel like you’re burning out it’s important to see your doctor or a qualified psychological professional. (This post is not intended to replace their advice). As I personally experienced, burnout can overlap with depression. Some experts even believe that burnout is a work-related form of depression. Other medical conditions can also present with similar symptoms. Life’s too short to feel continually stressed and at the end of your rope. Try these steps to take your life back, and see how much better you feel.</p> <p><strong>Original Post: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/prescriptions-for-life/201907/4-things-to-do-when-youre-burning-out-at-work">4 Things to Do When You’re Burning Out at Work</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Copyright belongs to the original author.</em></strong></p> <hr style="border: 2px solid;"/> <h1 id="应对工作倦怠的四个方法">应对工作倦怠的四个方法</h1> <p>Susan Biali Haas M.D. | 2019年7月19日 | 审阅：Gary Drevitch</p> <p>几年前，当我还是急诊医学住院医生时，我第一次经历了严重的倦怠（伴随着抑郁症）。 我再也不想跌入如此深的谷底，于是决定学习所有与韧性和心理健康相关的知识。</p> <p>十多年前，我开始作为教练工作，帮助忙碌且不堪重负的女性创造更加平衡、有意义的生活。 几乎每个客户都需要帮助应对某种与工作相关的压力。 在过去的几年里，大多数客户要么处在倦怠的边缘，要么深陷严重的工作疲惫中。</p> <p>很多人厌倦到了极点，他们雇我来帮助他们摆脱当前的职位，寻找其他工作。</p> <p>如果可能，我会建议客户先等待，并尝试做一些小的改变。 如果你正遭受真正的倦怠，你在情感和心理上都已经非常疲惫，不适合做出改变生活的重大决定。</p> <p>以下是我建议客户采取的步骤：</p> <p><strong>1. 找出是什么让你最感压力，并看看是否有解决方案。</strong></p> <p>倦怠领域的领军研究者Maslach和Leiter发现，有六个工作生活领域可能导致倦怠：工作负荷过重、缺乏控制、奖励不足、工作社区问题、不公平的做法和价值冲突。</p> <p>我正在和一位几乎表现出所有倦怠迹象的客户合作。 她正在认真考虑辞职，尽管她曾经热爱她的工作，仍然喜欢这家公司。 像她这样的情况，我担心她的离职想法几乎完全是由倦怠驱动的。</p> <p>一些非常具体的问题正在将她推向边缘。 她没有提交辞呈，而是向上级提出是否可以进行关键的改变。 他们非常重视她，已经同意回应她的请求。 如果他们的改变能够落实，带来的积极影响将是巨大的，比寻找新工作要方便得多。</p> <p><strong>2. 停止做不属于你的工作。</strong></p> <p>工作负荷过重是导致倦怠最常见的原因之一。 当我问客户他们在哪些方面可以减少工作量时，通常的回答是：“没有！” 我的下一个问题是：“你有没有在做本该是别人的工作？”</p> <p>几乎总是有的。 有高度责任感的人很容易倦怠，他们通常在做别人的工作。 他们想要帮助（拯救）他人，或者难以拒绝请求。 或者，完美主义作祟：虽然这不是他们的责任，但他们觉得别人做不好这项任务。</p> <p>如果你感到工作负担过重，审视一下你在做的所有工作，然后剔除掉那些你实际上不必做的工作。</p> <p><strong>3. 在工作和生活之间设定明确的界限。</strong></p> <p>另一位客户感到工作压力大，负担沉重，几乎没有属于自己的时间。 她每天早早开始工作，工作很长时间，通常会在晚上回到家后继续工作。 她其实不需要这样做，但总是感到有压力，最终默认在下班时间也在工作。</p> <p>当我问她可以怎么改变这种情况时，她立刻回答：“我可以把笔记本电脑留在公司！这样我回家时就被迫去做别的事情。” 完美的解决方案。 我有其他客户采取过类似的做法，比如把工作手机放在抽屉里——整个周末都不会碰它。</p> <p>你如何在工作和家庭之间划出更明确的界限？</p> <p><strong>4. 开始照顾好自己的身体。</strong></p> <p>如果你每晚睡眠时间不足七小时，你很可能会感到精疲力尽。 如果你跳过早餐、靠浓缩咖啡维持精力并整天吃垃圾食品，你一定会感觉糟糕，工作表现也会变得更差。 如果你整天坐在办公桌前，没有任何休息时间，也不进行锻炼，那么你感到易怒和压力大也就不足为奇了。</p> <p>如果你睡眠不足、饮食不规律或者一天几乎不运动，作为教练，我反倒觉得这是好消息，因为我知道，一旦你开始规律睡眠、饮食改善并多动起来，你会感觉好得多。 你甚至可能重新喜欢上你的工作。</p> <p>正如我常说的，如果你觉得自己快要倦怠，重要的是去看医生或合格的心理专家。 （这篇文章并非旨在取代他们的建议）。 正如我个人经历的那样，倦怠可能伴随有抑郁症。 一些专家甚至认为倦怠是一种与工作相关的抑郁症。 其他医学状况也可能表现出类似的症状。 生活太短暂了，不应该让自己总是感到压力重重、走投无路。 尝试这些步骤来找回你的生活，看看自己感觉会好多少。</p> <p><strong>原文链接: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/prescriptions-for-life/201907/4-things-to-do-when-youre-burning-out-at-work">4 Things to Do When You’re Burning Out at Work</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>版权属于原作者，本翻译仅供学习用途。</em></strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="repost"/><category term="phycology"/><category term="burnout"/><category term="CHN Available"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Burned out?

Heavy workloads, stressful jobs, and long work hours continue to leave employees at all levels feeling exhausted. In fact, Deloitte’s 2023 Workplace Well-Being Report found that 60 percent of employees, 64 percent of managers, and 75 percent of the C-suite are seriously considering quitting their jobs for one that would better support their well-being.</p> <p>But does that mean employees are burned out? Not so fast.</p> <p>The term burnout tends to be oversimplified as an individual failing of stress management and used interchangeably with exhaustion or overwhelm; however, burnout consists of more than just exhaustion. Burnout exists on a continuum that consists of these three dimensions:</p> <ol> <li>Chronic exhaustion (feeling physically and emotionally drained, tired, overwhelmed, and overloaded more often than not); and</li> <li>Chronic cynicism (people in your work world bother you and annoy you, and you may start to distance yourself from your colleagues and clients, ignoring the qualities that make them unique and engaging, resulting in less empathy); and</li> <li>Inefficacy (the “why bother, who cares” mentality that appears as you struggle to identify important work resources and begin to feel ineffective at work).</li> </ol> <p>This means that you can be exhausted only, feel cynical or frustrated only, or feel disconnected or disengaged from your work only; or, any number of other combinations. That’s important because the measurement of burnout also tends to be oversimplified.</p> <p>Drs. Christina Maslach and Michael Leiter, pioneers in burnout research and two of the developers of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, an empirically validated assessment tool that measures all three of the burnout components above, have issued updated guidance about what constitutes a “burnout profile.” According to their research, to earn the label “burnout,” a person must experience high exhaustion, high cynicism, and low professional efficacy. Based on their work, only about 20 percent of workers fit this profile.</p> <p>While I think that number is low, surveys that simply ask people, “Do you feel burned out?” are likely over-inflating burnout rates since most people equate burnout with exhaustion and therefore respond “yes” because they feel overwhelmed, stressed, or tired. As an example, the Wellbeing Lab in Australia found that 63.6 percent of Australian workers reported feeling burned out, but that level dropped to 21.2 percent when measured using the three dimensions above.</p> <p>If you’re feeling exhausted, but not yet burned out, here are some ideas to help:</p> <p><strong>1. List your job demands and resources.</strong></p> <p>Burnout is more likely to happen when you have too many job demands (aspects of your work that are consistently energy-draining) and too few job resources (aspects of your work that are consistently energy-giving). The two columns don’t have to be equal, but you do need enough energy-giving aspects of your work to mitigate the stress of the demands. What additional resources do you need?</p> <p><strong>2. Intentional prioritization.</strong></p> <p>A real estate developer client of mine used to prioritize his legal work for me using the terms, “nuclear,” “super nuclear,” and “catastrophic.” It still makes me laugh because it all sounds urgent and never gave me any clear guidance.</p> <p>Instead, I suggest trying this prioritization exercise I learned from the Luma Institute:</p> <p>Make a list of all of the projects, matters, and items you need to prioritize. Put one project, matter, or item on a sticky note until you have them all listed (one project per sticky note). Grab a large piece of paper and make a quad chart (four boxes in a 2x2 matrix). Label the horizontal axis “Importance” and label the vertical axis “Difficulty.” Plot items horizontally by importance and plot items vertically by difficulty. Look for related groupings and set priorities. Target the items in the lower right quadrant first because they are highly important and can be accomplished with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>3. Know your narratives.</strong></p> <p>Your “narratives” are your core values and beliefs about the way you think the world should operate. Not labeling these narratives can frustrate your ability to manage stress and prioritize your well-being. Here are some examples of common narratives I hear among busy professionals:</p> <ul> <li>“I must have all the answers.”</li> <li>“If I can’t do something perfectly, then I shouldn’t do it at all.”</li> <li>“Failure is a sign of weakness.”</li> <li>“Strong people don’t ask for help.”</li> <li>“Taking a break is a sign of laziness.” (This is one of my own!)</li> <li>“In order to be at the top of my game, I must always/never _______.”</li> </ul> <p>Narratives become rules you live by (oftentimes subconsciously) and are usually too inflexible to help you perform in an optimal way. The first step is identifying your narratives and rules; the second is evaluating them.</p> <p>Ask: Is this narrative getting me closer to or further away from the goals I want to achieve? How could I reshape the rule to make it a little more flexible? This is deep self-awareness work, but researcher Nick Petrie and his colleagues have discovered that it’s one of the best ways to prevent burnout (and a necessary step to get out of it).</p> <p><strong>4. Give yourself a break.</strong></p> <p>Just like remembering your small wins can increase motivation, overthinking small setbacks can kill it. Self-compassion is the art and science of giving yourself a break, and it can help prevent burnout. When you experience a setback, this framework will save you some much-needed energy:</p> <ol> <li>When you feel stressed, take a moment to describe the emotions you’re feeling. Do you feel self-critical, and if so, what do you say to yourself? Evaluating the emotions (which isn’t always easy) helps you better understand what you’re feeling before you rush to escape.</li> <li>Normalize the setback. You’re not the only person who has forgotten a key piece of information in a presentation or been frustrated with a colleague. Setbacks happen to everyone, but it’s tempting to think you’re the only one.</li> <li>What would you say to a friend who experienced the same setback? We beat ourselves up tremendously when we fail, but would you be just as harsh if your friend approached you with the same set of circumstances?</li> </ol> <p>Burnout rates are currently at the same level as their peak during the pandemic. I have spent the past several years working with teams and leaders around the globe to both educate and help solve this problem.</p> <p>Last year was my first year running my business and traveling for a full slate of programs as a single mom, a variable I highly underestimated. By December, I wondered ironically, “Am I burned out?” Once I asked myself about all three burnout factors, I quickly realized that I was simply exhausted.</p> <p>Not every experience of stress—even chronic stress—is burnout. Correctly identifying how you experience workplace stress is the first step toward feeling better.</p> <p><strong>Original Post: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pressure-proof/202308/are-you-burned-out-or-just-exhausted">Are You Burned Out or Just Exhausted?</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Copyright belongs to the original author.</em></strong></p> <hr style="border: 2px solid;"/> <h1 id="你是倦怠还是只是疲惫">你是倦怠还是只是疲惫？</h1> <p>Paula Davis J.D., M.A.P.P. | 2023年8月14日 | 审阅：Devon Frye</p> <p>你的工作状况如何？ 繁重的工作负担、压力大的工作和长时间的工作仍然让各级员工感到筋疲力尽。 事实上，德勤2023年工作场所健康报告发现，60%的员工、64%的管理者和75%的高管正在认真考虑辞职，以寻找一份能更好支持其身心健康的工作。</p> <p>但这是否意味着员工已经精疲力竭？ 不一定。</p> <p>“倦怠”一词往往被过度简化为个人无法管理压力的表现，常与疲惫或不堪重负等词互换使用；然而，倦怠远不止是疲惫。</p> <p>倦怠存在于一个由以下三个维度组成的连续体中：</p> <ol> <li>持续的疲惫（感到身心俱疲、疲倦、压力大、负荷过重，且这种感觉经常出现）；以及</li> <li>持续的冷漠（你工作中的人让你感到烦躁，你可能开始疏远同事和客户，忽略他们的独特之处，导致同理心减少）；以及</li> <li>无效感（你可能产生“为什么要费心，谁在乎”的想法，难以识别重要的工作资源，开始觉得自己在工作中无能为力）。</li> </ol> <p>这意味着你可能只是感到疲惫，或者仅仅感到冷漠或沮丧，或只是感到与工作脱节或失去参与感；或者，这些感受以各种不同的组合出现。 这很重要，因为倦怠的测量往往也被过度简化了。</p> <p>倦怠研究的先驱者，Maslach博士和Leiter博士是Maslach倦怠量表的开发者之一，这是一种经过验证的评估工具，用来测量上述倦怠的三个组成部分。 两位专家为“倦怠状态”提供了新的指导意见。 根据他们的研究，要被称为“倦怠”，一个人必须经历高度的疲惫、高度的冷漠和较低的职业效能感。 基于他们的工作，只有大约20%的员工符合这个倦怠状态的标准。</p> <p>虽然我认为这个比例较低，但那些仅仅询问人们“你是否感到倦怠？”的调查可能夸大了倦怠率，因为大多数人将倦怠等同于疲惫，因此回答“是”，因为他们感到不堪重负、压力大或疲惫。 例如，澳大利亚的Wellbeing Lab发现，63.6%的澳大利亚工人报告感到倦怠，但当使用上述三个维度进行测量时，这一比例下降到了21.2%。</p> <p>如果你感到疲惫，但还没有达到倦怠的程度，这里有一些建议可以帮助你：</p> <p><strong>1. 列出你的工作需求和资源。</strong></p> <p>当你的工作需求过多（工作中持续消耗精力的方面）而工作资源过少（工作中持续提供能量的方面）时，倦怠更有可能发生。 这两列不需要完全平衡，但你确实需要足够的工作资源来缓解工作需求带来的压力。 你还需要哪些额外的资源？</p> <p><strong>2. 有意的优先排序。</strong></p> <p>我曾经有一个房地产开发商客户，他用“核爆级”、“超级核爆级”和“灾难级”来优先排序他为我准备的法律工作。 这仍然让我发笑，因为这些都听起来很紧急，但并没有给我明确的指导。</p> <p>相反，我建议尝试Luma Institute教给我的这个优先排序练习：</p> <ul> <li>列出你所有需要优先处理的项目、事项和工作。把每个项目、事项或工作写在一张便签纸上，直到你把它们都列出来（每张便签纸上只写一个项目）。</li> <li>拿一张大纸，做一个四象限图（2x2矩阵的四个框）。</li> <li>将横轴标记为“重要性”，将纵轴标记为“难度”。</li> <li>按照重要性水平横向排列项目，并根据难度水平纵向排列项目。</li> <li>寻找相关的分组，并设定优先级。</li> </ul> <p>优先处理右下象限的项目，因为它们非常重要且相对容易完成。</p> <p><strong>3. 了解你的叙事。</strong></p> <p>你的“叙事”是你对世界应该如何运作的核心价值观和信念。 如果不标记这些叙述，它们可能会阻碍你管理压力和优先考虑自己的健康。 以下是我在繁忙的专业人士中经常听到的一些常见叙述：</p> <ul> <li>“我必须知道所有的答案。”</li> <li>“如果不能做到完美，我就不应该去做。”</li> <li>“失败是软弱的表现。”</li> <li>“坚强的人不会寻求帮助。”</li> <li>“休息是懒惰的表现。”（这是我自己的！）</li> <li>“为了保持最佳状态，我必须始终/绝不_______。”</li> </ul> <p>这些叙述成为你生活的规则（通常是潜意识的），并且往往过于僵化，无法帮助你以最佳方式工作。 第一步是识别你的叙述和规则；第二步是评估它们。</p> <p>问自己：这个叙述是否让我更接近或更远离我想要实现的目标？ 如何重新塑造这条规则，使其稍微灵活一些？ 这是一项深层次的自我意识工作，但研究员Nick Petrie及其同事发现，这是预防倦怠的最佳方法之一（也是摆脱倦怠的必要步骤）。</p> <p><strong>4. 给自己一个喘息的机会。</strong></p> <p>正如记住小小的胜利可以增加动力一样，过度思考小小的挫折则会扼杀动力。 自我关怀是一门艺术和科学，能够帮助你在需要时给自己一个喘息的机会，从而预防倦怠。 当你遇到挫折时，这个框架可以帮你节省宝贵的能量：</p> <ol> <li>当你感到压力时，花点时间描述你正在体验的情绪。你是否感到自责？如果是，你会对自己说些什么？评估这些情绪（这并不总是容易的）有助于你在急于逃避之前更好地理解自己的感受。</li> <li>正常化挫折。你不是唯一一个在演讲中忘记关键信息或对同事感到沮丧的人。挫折每个人都会遇到，但我们往往认为自己是唯一的例外。</li> <li>如果你的朋友遇到了同样的挫折，你会对他说些什么？当我们失败时，我们往往对自己非常苛刻，但如果你的朋友以同样的情况向你求助，你会同样苛刻吗？</li> </ol> <p>目前的倦怠率与疫情期间的峰值相同。 过去几年，我一直在与全球各地的团队和领导者合作，既进行教育，也帮助解决这个问题。</p> <p>去年是我第一次作为单身母亲经营自己的业务，并为一整年的项目安排旅行，我严重低估了这个变量。 到12月时，我不禁自嘲地问：“我是不是倦怠了？” 一旦我问自己这三个倦怠因素，我很快意识到自己只是疲惫而已。</p> <p>并非所有的压力体验（即使是长期压力）都是倦怠。 正确识别你在工作场所体验压力的方式是改善感觉的第一步。</p> <p><strong>原文链接: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pressure-proof/202308/are-you-burned-out-or-just-exhausted">Are You Burned Out or Just Exhausted?</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>版权属于原作者，本翻译仅供学习用途。</em></strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="repost"/><category term="phycology"/><category term="burnout"/><category term="CHN Available"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What you need to recover from each is different.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Basic and Complex Emotions</title><link href="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/basic-and-complex-emotions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Basic and Complex Emotions"/><published>2024-10-14T00:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-14T00:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/basic-and-complex-emotions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jinningwang.github.io/blog/2024/basic-and-complex-emotions/"><![CDATA[<p>Berit Brogaard D.M.Sci., Ph.D | Posted June 30, 2018 | Reviewed by Jessica Schrader</p> <p>It is commonplace in philosophy and psychology to divide emotions into two groups: basic and complex emotions.</p> <p>Complex emotions, such as grief, regret, and jealousy, have highly variable appearances and compositions.</p> <p>Basic emotions, which include sadness, anger, fear, disgust, contempt, joy, and surprise, are so-called because they are associated with universally recognizable facial expressions (see image). In disgust, for example, you see a raised upper lip, a wrinkled nose bridge, and raised cheeks.</p> <p>Although basic emotions are sometimes accompanied by unique facial expressions and behavioral responses, there is no one-one correspondence between emotions and how they appear. Take the universally recognizable facial expressions. Very talented actors can mimic these facial expressions without having the associated emotion. Conversely, most of us are masters in suppressing facial expressions accompanying emotions. You might feel genuinely sad, yet put on a big smile before entering your workplace, thereby deceiving your colleagues into thinking that you are cheerful.</p> <p>Even when our emotional expressions reflect our inner mental life, they need not be universally recognizable. This is because the basic emotions can trigger many other expressions besides the unique facial expressions, physiological responses, and tendencies to act. Examples:</p> <ol> <li>Intense sadness might give rise to a facial expression nearly indistinguishable from anger or rage.</li> <li>Mild sadness may not look like anything at all.</li> <li>When several emotions are simultaneously present, one of the emotions may dominate and show up on your face.</li> <li>When emotions last for a long time, they pop in and out of your conscious awareness. When you are not aware of them, It is much harder to detect them.</li> </ol> <p>Basic emotions likely have made significant contributions to our survival since the beginning of human history. When understood in this sense, “basic”—as it occurs in “basic emotion”—just means primordial (evolutionarily basic).</p> <p>But if an emotion is truly basic, how could it have more basic components? Take surprise. We can split surprise into two responses: one is a positive sense of interest and wonder, and the other is a negative feeling of panic. Why call surprise “basic” when it’s composed of other emotions?</p> <p>The reason for this is that “basic” does not mean “lacks components.”</p> <p>In fact, complex emotions vary a lot in what they are like in different people, situations, and cultures. Although grief is often taken to be a blend of surprise, denial, sadness and anger, grief can be entirely different in some people or cultures. For example, some people grieve a loss without ever showing anger. Others grieve by being absolutely furious.</p> <p>Grief is often said to be composed of surprise, denial, bargaining, fear, anger, sadness, and acceptance. These components are not usually present all at the same time during a grieving episode but tend to occur sequentially and not necessarily in the order I just listed them in. Although grief can involve these building blocks, it can be manifested in numerous other ways. If the loss was expected, surprise may not be a component. If you are grieving the death of a loved one, the grief may not involve denial or bargaining. If, by contrast, you are grieving a breakup, you may go through long periods of denying that the breakup really is a breakup and ferociously negotiate and bargain with your ex. Grief can also involve alterations in mood, including feelings of depression, despair, melancholy, irritability or anxiety as well as temporary changes in the manifest features of personality, for instance, shifting toward isolation, insecurity, emotionality, and vigilance.</p> <p>It’s likely because complex emotions can be a blend of different mental states in different people, situations and cultures that they do not give rise to a facial expression that is universally recognized.</p> <p><strong>Original Post: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201807/basic-and-complex-emotions">Basic and Complex Emotions</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Copyright belongs to the original author.</em></strong></p> <hr style="border: 2px solid;"/> <h1 id="基本情绪和复杂情绪">基本情绪和复杂情绪</h1> <p>Berit Brogaard D.M.Sci., Ph.D | 2018年6月30日 | 审阅：Jessica Schrader</p> <p>在哲学和心理学中，情绪通常被分为两类：基本情绪和复杂情绪。</p> <p>复杂情绪，如悲伤、后悔和嫉妒，具有高度可变的表现形式和组成部分。</p> <p>基本情绪包括悲伤、愤怒、恐惧、厌恶、蔑视、快乐和惊讶，它们之所以被称为“基本”，是因为它们与普遍可识别的面部表情相关联。 例如，在厌恶的情绪中，你会看到上唇抬起、鼻梁皱起、面颊上扬。</p> <p>虽然基本情绪有时伴随着独特的面部表情和行为反应，但情绪和它们的表现之间并不存在一一对应关系。 以那些普遍可识别的面部表情为例。 非常有才华的演员可以模仿这些面部表情，而不产生相应的情绪。 相反，我们大多数人都擅长抑制伴随情绪的面部表情。 你可能真的感到悲伤，但在进入工作场所前露出大大的笑容，从而让同事误以为你很开心。</p> <p>即使我们的情绪表达反映了内心的精神生活，它们也未必是普遍可识别的。 这是因为基本情绪除了独特的面部表情、生理反应和行为倾向之外，还会引发许多其他的表现。 例子如下：</p> <ol> <li>强烈的悲伤可能导致的面部表情几乎无法与愤怒或暴怒区分开来。</li> <li>轻微的悲伤可能根本没有任何外在表现。</li> <li>当几种情绪同时存在时，其中一种情绪可能会占据主导地位，并在你的脸上表现出来。</li> <li>当情绪持续较长时间时，它们会在你的意识中进进出出。当你没有意识到它们时，情绪变得更难被察觉。</li> </ol> <p>基本情绪很可能自人类历史开端以来对我们的生存做出了重要贡献。 在这个意义上，“基本”（在“基本情绪”中的意思）只是指原始的（进化意义上的基本）。</p> <p>但如果一种情绪是真正的基本情绪，它怎么可能有更基本的成分呢？ 比如惊讶。 我们可以将惊讶分为两种反应：一种是积极的兴趣和好奇感，另一种是消极的恐慌感。 既然惊讶由其他情绪组成，为什么还称它为“基本”情绪呢？</p> <p>原因在于“基本”并不意味着“没有成分”。</p> <p>事实上，复杂情绪在不同人、不同情境和不同文化中有很大的差异。 虽然悲伤常被认为是惊讶、否认、悲伤和愤怒的混合体，但在某些人或文化中，悲伤可能完全不同。 例如，有些人在失去时从不表现出愤怒。其他人则通过愤怒来表达悲伤。</p> <p>悲伤常被认为由惊讶、否认、讨价还价、恐惧、愤怒、悲伤和接受组成。 这些成分通常不会在悲伤的过程中同时出现，而是会按顺序发生，并且不一定是我刚才列出的顺序。 虽然悲伤可能涉及这些构建块，但它可以通过许多其他方式表现出来。 如果损失是预料之中的，惊讶可能就不是成分之一。如果你为一位亲人的去世而悲伤，悲伤可能不涉及否认或讨价还价。 相反，如果你为一场分手而悲伤，你可能会经历长时间的否认分手的现实，并激烈地与前任讨价还价。 悲伤还可能伴随情绪的变化，包括抑郁、绝望、忧郁、易怒或焦虑的感觉，以及个性外在特征的临时改变，例如向孤立、不安全感、情绪化和警觉性转变。</p> <p>复杂情绪可能因为在人、情境和文化中的不同精神状态混合而成，所以它们不会引发普遍可识别的面部表情。</p> <p><strong>原文链接: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201807/basic-and-complex-emotions">Basic and Complex Emotions</a></strong></p> <p><strong><em>版权属于原作者，本翻译仅供学习用途。</em></strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="repost"/><category term="phycology"/><category term="emotions"/><category term="CHN Available"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cultural variation and evolutionary advantages.]]></summary></entry></feed>
