Project Title: Cyber-Physical Dynamic System (CPDS) Modeling for Frequency Regulation and AGC Services of Distributed Energy Resources

Date: 1/2022 â€“ 12/2022

Affiliation: University of Tennessee, Knoxville; NREL

Advisor: Fangxing Fran Li, Xin Fang (MSU), Wenbo Wang (NREL)

This project aims to develop an open-source, scalable, transmission, distribution, and communication, dynamic co-simulation framework to study the impacts of communication failures of distributed energy resources (DERs) providing frequency regulation services on electric power system stability.

As part of this project, Jinning focused on exploring the use of electric vehicles (EVs) to provide secondary frequency regulation services.
By integrating EVs into the grid for this purpose, the project aims to address critical aspects of grid frequency stability.
